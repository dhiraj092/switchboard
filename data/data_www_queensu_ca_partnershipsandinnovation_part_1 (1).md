## 
###### _Photo credit - Stephen Wild (October 18, 2024)_
The University Council was established by statute in 1874. It is one of the three governing bodies of the University. The elective members of the Council are elected by and from among the alumni of the University in a manner provided for by the By-laws of the Council.  The Council serves as both an advisory and an ambassadorial body to the University as a whole and is responsible for the election of the Chancellor.
Although it is not directly involved in operations, the Council may bring to the Senate or Board of Trustees any matter that it believes affects Queen's well-being and prosperity. In this way the Council, in plenary session and through study committees, has made important contributions to several areas of campus life.

Some people, including alumni, may not remember their **NetID**, while others may never have been issued one while they were students.
The NetID is an issued combination of letters and numbers which is unique to each student. Think of it as your individual passkey to unlocking online services from Queen's.
If you don't have a **NetID**, you can [activate one.](https://netid.queensu.ca/identityiq/external/registration.jsf#/register)
This utility will require two things – one of which is your Student ID Number. If you do not remember your Student ID Number, you can contact the Office of the University Registrar at 613-533-6894. Once we have verified your identity by asking you a number of questions, we will provide you with your student number. In order to ensure your privacy, we will not provide student numbers by email.
**If you have your NetID, and don't remember your password, you can do either of the following:**
* If you created your Challenge Questions and supplied an Alternate Email Address, you can use the **[Self-Service Password Reset Tool](https://netid.queensu.ca/identityiq/external/registration.jsf#/register "link to Identity Manager")**

# [Give Support: Responding to a Disclosure](https://www.queensu.ca/sexualviolencesupport/give-support-responding-disclosure) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/sexualviolencesupport/give-support-responding-disclosure_

1. [It’s Not Your Fault. We Believe You.](https://www.queensu.ca/sexualviolencesupport/support)
2. Give Support: Responding to a disclosure
#####   Listen to, validate, and believe your friend.
Validate your friends' feelings about the violence, reaffirm that it is not their fault and that you believe them. It's important to be mindful of tone when they tell you about what happened - if you sound doubtful or like you do not believe your friend, they will feel unsupported and be less likely to seek help from other sources.
#####   Ensure you’re asking your friend what they need, don’t make any assumptions.
It is important for your friend to regain a sense of self-control – offering options and respecting the decisions your friend makes can help them regain a sense of control over their life. You may have your own anger about what happened but it’s important that you channel that anger to supporting your friend and avoid pushing your own opinions or feelings on them.
#####   Help your friend find resources.
There are many people and services who can provide them an array of support. Click the link below to visit our [Get Support](https://www.queensu.ca/sexualviolencesupport/support "It’s not your fault. We believe you.") page and our list of on and off campus resources.
#####   Avoid asking for details or specifics.
It’s important that you ask your friend questions about what they need, and you avoid pushing for explicit details about what happened. Asking questions like what they were wearing, what they did to encourage or discourage the assault, or how much alcohol/substances were used are harmful questions that will make your friend feel like you’re interrogating them and not believing what they have told you. It can also make them feel like you’re minimizing what happened.
#####   Don’t share what your friend told you without permission.
Your friend may want and need privacy at this time and you breaking that privacy can cause more anxiety and trauma. It can be helpful for them to have more support, you can always ask _“Is it okay if I talk to my mom/my Don/the Sexual Violence Prevention & Response Coordinator about this?”_ or _“Do you want to also tell X and Y friend? I think they would want to support you through this too.”_
#####   Continue to show your friend that you support and care about them.
Small things can be very meaningful – cooking dinner together, picking up a favourite dessert or snack item, sending funny articles or TikTok videos. If your friend experiences something that reminds them about the incident, taking a couple of hours to spend time with them can make a big difference. It may seem obvious to you but reminding your friend that they are loved and that they matter is also very important. You friend may feel a combination of emotions linked to self-blame such as feeling weak or stupid.
#####   Recognize there is no timeline for healing from sexual violence.
Experiencing sexual violence can be traumatizing, and everyone handles it differently. It can take years for someone to process the violation that happened to them and their body. It's important that you don’t set a timeline for when your friend should be “over it” and that you also encourage your friend to be patient with themselves.
#####   Understand your own limits.
As much as you want to be there for your friend, social workers, psychologists, counselors, and psychiatrists have the training to offer long-term support. Take care of yourself and your own mental health.

# [Procedural Fairness | Office of the University Ombudsperson](https://www.queensu.ca/ombuds/appeal-process/procedural-fairness) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/ombuds/appeal-process/procedural-fairness_

## Student Rights and Responsibilities
Faculty communication along with many University policies and procedures reference student rights and responsibilities but the meaning behind it is often confusing. In most cases, in the context at the University, the student’s right is in reference to the right to procedural fairness in any academic decisions across the University, along with the student’s right to appeal any academic decision (assuming the grounds for appeal are met).
[Appeal processes](https://www.queensu.ca/ombuds/appeal-process/appeal-process "Appeal Process") were developed to reconsider the appropriateness of any sanctions or penalties that may have been imposed upon a student.
Students have a responsibility to familiarize themselves with the [Senate Student Academic Appeals Policy (SAAP)](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/senate/student-academic-appeals-policy) , as well the specific academic regulations from their home Faculty. The SAAP policy in particular includes reference to resources for students and the responsibilities and authority of Faculty and Schools.
## Procedural Fairness
Helping to ensure procedural fairness in decision making across the University is one of the central roles of our office. It relates to the **steps** taken by the decision maker **before** and **after** making a decision or responding to an appeal.
_Procedural fairness has four major components:_
**1. The right to know the case against you 
2. The right to an impartial decision maker 
3. The opportunity to have your views considered by the person or people making the decision 
4. The right to a decision and the rationale for that decision**
**Notice**
**Information**
**Right to Respond**
**Impartiality**
**Reasons**
Advance notice of consideration of a decision must be given to the student.
Student must have access to the information that is being considered.
Student must be given a meaningful opportunity to have their opinion considered.
The decision maker must be impartial and appear to be unbiased.
The decision maker must give meaningful reasons for the decision or the outcome.

 _https://www.queensu.ca/residences/life-residence/why-choose-queens-residence_

## Community and Belonging
“I loved my experience in residence. I can safely say that my time in Leonard Hall was the best year I've had at Queen's. All of my housemates now lived on my floor three years ago, and we will likely be friends for life. There is nothing better than Lenny brunch or a late-night Lazy burrito with friends.”

1. Records Management
2. [Managing University Records](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/records-management/university-records)
3. Store Records
Records and documents that are no longer used frequently can be placed in secure storage in the interests of saving office space.  When storing **hardcopy records** on campus, do not store boxes in areas where they may be insecure, where they may be moved without the unit’s knowledge, or where they could be exposed to hazards such as water or pests.
**Electronic records** with a long or permanent retention period should be retained on the University's network so that they are maintained through system upgrades and do not become unavailable due to software or hardware obsolescence. They should not be stored on removable media—such as USB drives, or external hard drives—which are easily lost and thus present a security problem, or over time become corrupted and unreadable.
## Offsite Storage
The University’s preferred supplier for offsite records and document storage is Iron Mountain. Your unit's Records Management Contact will have access to the Iron Mountain Connect online portal to facilitate the pick up and retrieval of your records boxes. If you are unsure of who your unit's Records Management Contact person is, please contact the [Records Manager](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/contact-us "Contact Us"). 
### **Move Records to Iron Mountain**
​Contact the Records Manager **before** you start to prepare your records for transfer. The Records Management and Privacy Office now scans your boxes in order to pre-populate the inventory sheet, then sends that pre-populated form to you.
Users will then fill out the remaining required fields of the transfer form and submit the it to the Records Manager for final review. Once the spreadsheet has been approved the Records Manager will send it to Iron Mountain and notify you that a pick up can be arranged using IM Connect.
_Note that only records that have a disposal date under an authorized [records retention schedule](https://archives.queensu.ca/records-retention-schedules) should be moved to offsite storage._

###### _Photo credit - Stephen Wild (October 18, 2024)_
The University Council was established by statute in 1874. It is one of the three governing bodies of the University. The elective members of the Council are elected by and from among the alumni of the University in a manner provided for by the By-laws of the Council.  The Council serves as both an advisory and an ambassadorial body to the University as a whole and is responsible for the election of the Chancellor.
Although it is not directly involved in operations, the Council may bring to the Senate or Board of Trustees any matter that it believes affects Queen's well-being and prosperity. In this way the Council, in plenary session and through study committees, has made important contributions to several areas of campus life.

# [Research Protocols | Records Management and Privacy Office](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/information/research-protocols)

## Protocol for Requesting Access to Personal Information in a Queen’s University Record for a Research Purpose
### Authority
Queen’s University will comply with section 21(1)(e) of the [_Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act_](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90f31) (“FIPPA”) which authorizes the disclosure of personal information for a research purpose if:
(i) the disclosure is consistent with the conditions or reasonable expectations of disclosure under which the personal information was provided, collected or obtained,
(ii) the research purpose for which the disclosure is to be made cannot be reasonably accomplished unless the information is provided in individually identifiable form, and
(iii) the person who is to receive the record has agreed to comply with the conditions relating to security and confidentiality prescribed by the regulations. \[See [Regulation 460, section 10(1)](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/900460).\]
Requests for access to personal information in University records will be handled as formal FIPPA requests through the [Records Management and Privacy Office](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/node/14).  _Note: Requests for access to University records that have been placed in the Queen’s University Archives will be coordinated by the [University Archivist](https://archives.queensu.ca/)._
### Procedures
1\. Researchers wishing to use operational University records containing personal information for a research purpose will first consult with the University office responsible for the records to determine whether the records can be anonymized. If so, the researcher can liaise with the responsible office and is not required to submit a formal FIPPA request. _Note: University offices may wish to consult with the Records Management and Privacy Office if there is any concern about the anonymization._
2\. If anonymization is not possible, researchers will consult with the [Records Management and Privacy Office](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/node/14) in order to discuss the project and submit a formal FIPPA request for access to the records.
3\. As part of the request, the researcher will be asked to complete the Research Agreement template which will include a description of the research project, a rationale for using records in personally identifiable form, a detailed list of records to be consulted, and assurances that the records will be treated securely and confidentially. The Director, University Records Management and Chief Privacy Officer will deliberate on the merits of the application, consulting other offices within the University as appropriate. The final decision on access to records will be made by the designated decision-maker as outlined in the FIPPA Delegation of Authority.
4\. Researchers who are granted access to personal information for a research purpose will be able to access the requested records for a period of two years.

The Tri-Council Policy Statement on Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans—known as [TCPS2 (2018)](https://ethics.gc.ca/eng/policy-politique_tcps2-eptc2_2018.html) —requires the approval of a Research Ethics Board (REB) for secondary use of information for a research purpose. Secondary use means using information collected originally for a purpose other than the current research purpose, such as records created for administration or operations, or records created for a different research project. Article 5.5 requires that REB approval be sought for the secondary use of both identifiable information and de-identified/anonymized information. Article 5.5A specifically permits the use of identifiable information without consent under certain circumstances.
Personal health information is, by definition, identifiable information. (_If information is not identifiable (e.g., if it has been de-identified or anonymized), then it is not personal health information and this protocol does not apply._) The Personal Health Information Protection Act (“PHIPA”) permits the disclosure of personal health information by a **Health Information Custodian**, or **HIC**, for a research purpose in situations where it is impractical for the researcher to seek consent from the individuals to whom the information relates.
In accordance with section 44(1) of PHIPA, Queen’s University’s HICs (see Schedule A below) may authorize disclosure of personal health information for a research purpose if the researcher:
1. submits to the University:
 * an application in writing,
 * a research plan that meets the requirements of section 44(2) of PHIPA, and
 * a copy of the decision of a research ethics board that approves the research plan; and
2. enters into the agreement required by section 44(5).
The **flow chart below** outlines the process for accessing records containing personal health information from a Queen’s University HIC. Researchers with a connection to Queen’s University will follow the normal process for approval through a research ethics board with the goal of obtaining a data transfer agreement. Researchers without a connection to Queen’s University will apply through the University’s Privacy Office with the goal of obtaining a research agreement.
Access to records containing personal health information that have been transferred to the Queen’s University Archives will be coordinated by the University Archivist.
N.B. Requests from individuals for access to their own PHI can be treated in accordance with normal unit access procedures or as a FIPPA request through the Records Management and Privacy Office.

1. [Queen's Student Accessibility Services (QSAS)](https://www.queensu.ca/studentwellness/accessibility-services)
2. QSAS Vision & Mission
## QSAS Vision & Mission
## Vision
A universally inclusive and accessible educational experience that fosters independence and autonomy for all students with disabilities.
* * *
We cultivate accessibility and inclusivity by:
* Providing opportunity for students to cultivate autonomy, confidence, and self-advocacy skills.
* Developing ongoing partnerships with students, faculty and staff.
* * *
## Scope
QSAS seeks to support and empower students experiencing disability related barriers to access and fully participate in their own educational experience. We do this by providing educational supports to students based on their first-person experience of disability and as well as supporting documentation.
QSAS **does**:
* Work with students and/or their documentation to put accommodations in place that remove barriers to accessing education
* Develop long term plans to support students in their academics
* Create Letters of Accommodations
* Support student navigation of the accommodation system
QSAS **does not**:
* Provide crisis or emergency counselling to students
 * For crisis or emergency counselling services, please visit [Student Wellness Services](https://www.queensu.ca/studentwellness/get-help-now) 
* Advocate for students on Academic Appeals
* Advocate for Incomplete, Aegrotat, or Credit Standing status for students

# [Acronyms and abbreviations | Accessibility Hub](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/across-campus/web-standards-and-accessibility-development-guide/writing-web/acronyms-and) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/across-campus/web-standards-and-accessibility-development-guide/writing-web/acronyms-and_

## Accessibility Recommendations
In general, screen readers do not recognize abbreviations and acronyms, and generally read them as if they were typical English words. For instance the acronym "ITS" would not be read by screen readers as the intended "_I.T.S._", but as "_It's_". To assist with accessibility we suggest:
1. Using periods between letters (e.g. I.T.S. versus ITS) in an acronym may help screen readers parse the acronym.
 
2. When writing an acronym in an ALT tag, add spaces between characters (e.g. <alt="I T S" >).
 
## Other Guidelines
Never assume that the end reader knows what the acronym or abbreviation stands for. Even common terms (like "M.B.A." for instance) should be clearly defined when first introduced (see example below). Also consider that an acronym or abbreviation in one sphere may not mean the same in another (eg. "C.A.S." has been used for both the Children's Aid Society and the Canadian AIDS Society).
When the term is used within a collection of web pages, it must be fully defined on each page in the collection, as users potentially will not start at "page 1" (due to search-engine results, deep linking , etc.).
While there are programmatic techniques that can encode expanded definitions of acronyms and abbreviations, each initial introduction of an acronym or abbreviation must first be written in full in the page content, followed by its shortened form in brackets. Subsequent use of the acronym or abbreviation on that page need not be defined. For example:
"Canadians looking to propel their careers into the international business arena can now earn an Ivy League Masters of Business Administration (M.B.A.) in 17 months while they continue to work in Canada with the new Queen's-Cornell International Executive M.B.A."

1. Community
2. Services for the Queen's community
The Queen's Partnerships and Innovation (QPI) team supports the University’s strategic goal to build community partnerships and fully embed Queen’s in the community. We offer numerous services and resources to Queen’s faculty members, students, post-docs, and Research Centres and Institutes. 
## Strategic partnerships
The QPI team participates in several strategic consortia and can advise you of resources and/or opportunities to engage with member organizations. The team is happy to connect you with the appropriate connections to further your work. 
 [Contact us to connect with consortia and resources](mailto:qpi.info@queensu.ca?subject=Consortia%20introduction)
In partnership with the Kingston Economic Development Corporation and relevant organizations in Syracuse, the QPI team facilitates discussions between Queen's faculty members wishing to explore and build cross-border research collaborations with the State University of New York (SUNY) campuses, including SUNY Upstate Medical University and the Upstate University Hospital, and supports or connects startups and SMEs looking to establish business relationships or premises in Upper State New York or in Eastern Ontario.
 [Contact us to learn more about the Kingston-Syracuse Pathway](mailto:qpi.info@queensu.ca?subject=Inquiry%20regarding%20Kingston-Syracuse%20Pathway)
## Relationship building
## Legal
As Research Centres and Institutes, faculty members, post-docs and students become more entrepreneurial and more focused on opportunities to commercialize intellectual property, and-or may be working in or managing a busy laboratory with multiple students and projects including projects with industry partners, it is important to document roles, responsibilities, and rights of the university, faculty members and students. These arrangements can be novel as well as complex.
The Research Legal Services is responsible for the primary coordination, negotiation, and administration of research-related agreements for Queen's University and the affiliated teaching hospitals. 
 [Contact Research Legal Services to discuss your specific situation and objectives.](mailto:researchlegal@queensu.ca?subject=Inquiry%20regarding%20research%20or%20innovation-related%20agreements%20and%20contracts)
Please note that faculty members are not authorized by the university to sign research- or innovation-related agreements. For more information about this policy, please visit the [Research Contracts page on the University Secretariat and Legal Counsel website](http://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/board-policies/policy-approval-and-execution-contracts-and-invoices/research-contracts) .

## Intellectual Property and Commercialization
To access policies related to intellectual property or research contracts and agreements, please visit our [Policies page](https://www.queensu.ca/partnershipsandinnovation/node/78).
The QPI team has patent agents and other staff members who can provide advice on patentability, commercialization, and other intellectual property matters. The QPI team is responsible for drafting, filing, and prosecuting patent applications, managing patent portfolios, and providing strategies for intellectual property protection.
 [Contact us to discuss your inventions and other intellectual property](mailto:qpi.info@queensu.ca?subject=Inquiry%20regarding%20inventions%20and%20IP)
As required of QUFA, should faculty members wish to commercialize an invention, they will need to complete and submit a disclosure form. This form documents a specific invention and helps the QPI team to evaluate its commercial potential.
 [Please visit our Inventions and Intellectual Property page for these forms.](https://www.queensu.ca/partnershipsandinnovation/node/142)
Discoveries and inventions usually follow one of the two following commercialization paths: a license to an established company or a license to a newly formed startup company.
 [Contact us to discuss licensing strategies](mailto:qpi.info@queensu.ca?subject=Inquiry%20regarding%20licensing%20strategies)
## Internships, Funding and Talent
Top organizations are looking for top talent. Mitacs offers the opportunity to apply to hundreds of research and innovation internships across Canada. 
 [Visit the Mitacs page to learn more](https://www.mitacs.ca/)
## Workshops and events
QPI designs and delivers bespoke versions of its Market-Focused Research Workshop Series, upon request, to cohorts of faculty members, post-doctoral fellows or graduate students, who are interested in knowledge mobilization and commercialization of research outcomes. The Workshop Seriescovers topics such as market/technology assessments, design thinking, intellectual property, effective communication, and commercialization strategies to support research, research partnerships, and commercialization/startup formation activities.
The Market-Focused Research (Health) program is designed for faculty members, post-doctoral fellows or graduate students, and who are interested in translational life sciences research and its commercialization. The program emphasizes gaining an understanding of the needs of industry and customers, incorporating possible solutions to satisfy those needs into the earliest stages of research, which can significantly improve commercial potential.
Participants will learn skills related to market/technology assessment, design thinking, intellectual property, communication, and strategies/considerations for technology commercialization. Unique aspects of healthcare commercialization will be discussed including navigating regulatory complexity, quality control, and conducting clinical trials.
Upon request or invitation, the QPI team can deliver an array of workshops and specific training sessions for departments, associated faculty members, and researchers; and coordinates and delivers interactive sector-specific workshops to facilitate engagement between faculty members and industry.
## Communications and Marketing
Using a variety of communication channels, the QPI team promotes successful research collaborations, which we help to establish and/or facilitate, and works with University Relations, Faculties, Departments and/or faculty members and partners to identify and publicize the objectives, outcomes, and impacts of research partnerships and specific collaborations.
  [Contact us to propose a story](mailto:qpi.info@queensu.ca?subject=Proposal%20for%20story%20involving%20Queen%27s%20Partnerships%20and%20Innovation%20)
The QPI team also promotes the accomplishments of entrepreneurs, startups, and SMEs with which we are working in Eastern Ontario. In addition to written communications, the QPI team utilizes our extensive innovation ecosystem to conduct outreach activities to industry and partners in the community.

# [Accessibility & Accommodations | Residence](https://www.queensu.ca/residences/life-residence/accessibility-accommodations) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/residences/life-residence/accessibility-accommodations_

We encourage you to submit your residence accommodation request as soon as possible. This gives us appropriate time to review your request prior to room self-selection and gather any additional information as necessary. All residence health accommodation requests require a completed Residence Health Accommodation Form from a healthcare provider – please consider wait times to see your practitioner when determining an appropriate timeline for submission.
You can submit accommodation requests related to health, gender identity expression, and/or creed/spirituality at any time after the deadline and throughout the academic year. However, given the time required to review requests and our historically high occupancy rate, if a request for an accommodation is provided later than the deadline of June 3, we may not be able to provide you with a space that meets your approved accommodation in time for self-selection and/or move-in. We will continue to offer relevant bedspaces as they become available throughout the year. Please note that because we typically have a high occupancy rate, room availability can be limited and we cannot guarantee what room types will become available during the year, or when.
We encourage all students who require an accommodation for reasons related to health, gender identity expression, and/or creed/spirituality to thoroughly read through this guide and the relevant form(s) (Residence Health Accommodation Form and/or Non-Health Accommodation Form) to understand the full expectations of submission and limits of the accommodation process. Residence Accommodation Forms are available through the [Student Residence and Dining Portal](https://studentweb.housing.queensu.ca/) after you have submitted your initial Residence application.
You must complete your residence application before you can access the Residence Health or Residence Non-health Accommodation Form.
To complete your residence application log in through the [Student Residence and Dining Portal](https://studentweb.housing.queensu.ca/)
### Residence Health Accommodations
1. Navigate to the Residence Health Accommodations page of the residence application.
2. Click “I plan to submit a health accommodation”.
3. Complete your residence application.
4. Go back to the home page of the Student Residence and Dining Portal.
5. Click on the “Health Accommodations” icon.
6. Download the Health Accommodations form (PDF).
7. Take the PDF to your healthcare provider and discuss your accommodation requirements for living in residence with them. Once you have done this, ask them to complete the form, sign it, and stamp it with their office stamp. It is your responsibility to ensure the form is completed in full by the healthcare provider and you understand the specific information and accommodations that have been identified on your form. If a stamp is not available you may upload a copy of the healthcare provider’s letterhead as an additional document.
8. Upload the PDF through the Student Residence and Dining Portal in the same place you downloaded it through the Health Accommodation icon. You may also choose to upload supporting documentation under the “Supporting Documentation” icon.
 1. Click “File”.
 2. Select the file you wish to upload from the place it is saved on your device/cloud.
 3. Click “Upload”.
 4. Your file is uploaded – to be sure, you should see the filename of the file you uploaded. You can log out and back in to make sure the file was uploaded.
 5. Please ensure your PDF is not password protected at the time of upload as it may impact the ability to read the document.
We are only able to accept Residence Health Accommodation Forms in PDF format which have been uploaded through the Student Residence and Dining Portal. We are unable to accept forms submitted via email.
### Residence Non-Health Accommodations
1. Navigate to the Non-Health Accommodations page of the residence application.
2. Click “I plan to submit a non-health accommodation”.
3. Complete your residence application.
4. Go back to the home page of the Student Residence and Dining Portal.

 1. Click “File”.
 2. Select the file you wish to upload from the place it is saved on your device/cloud.
 3. Click “Upload”.
 4. Your file is uploaded – to be sure, you should see the filename of the file you uploaded. You can log out and back in to make sure the file was uploaded.
 5. Please ensure your PDF is not password protected at the time of upload as it may impact the ability to read the document.
We are only able to accept Residence Non-Health Accommodation Forms in PDF format which have been uploaded through the Student Residence and Dining Portal. We are unable to accept forms submitted via email.
#### Gender Identity Expression
1. Indicate why you are requesting an accommodation. The more information we have, the easier it is for us to understand the nature of your request and provide you with an appropriate accommodation, however, you are only required to provide as much information as you feel comfortable sharing.
2. Gender identity expression requests may require follow-up information to ensure room placements fit specific needs. If this is necessary, the Residence Admissions team will contact you directly.
#### Creed/Spiritual
1. Indicate the accommodation need. We recognize that different people practice and experience faith and spirituality in different ways, and that commonly used labels do not always fully articulate the ways in which someone practices or observes their faith/spirituality. As such we do not make assumptions about specific needs based on what may to you be an obvious term (e.g., Christian, Muslim, Jewish). Instead, we invite you to share as much information relevant to your accommodation as you feel comfortable doing. The more information we have, the better we can understand the nature of your request.
##### Next Steps
1. You will receive an automated email to let you know that we have received your Residence Accommodation Form. The Residence Admissions team will assess your request. Our team may reach out to ask for more information or clarification.
 1. If you do not receive an automated email within 20 minutes please check your junk mail and then contact [residencesupport@queensu.ca](mailto:residencesupport@queensu.ca)
2. You will receive an email from the Residence Support Coordinator when your accommodation request has been reviewed. The email will let you know what accommodation(s) you have been approved for, or ask for additional information.
3. If a Queen’s email has been assigned you will be contacted at your Queen’s email address.
4. You will receive an email in early July indicating your self-selection date.
5. Room self-selection will take place the week of July 15. You will have access to rooms that meet your approved accommodation.
The timeline for response to accommodation requests can vary depending on time of year. We ask that you be patient during the process.
**Health accommodations:** require a completed Residence Health Accommodation Form available through the [Student Residence and Dining Portal](https://studentweb.housing.queensu.ca/).
You will need to have your Residence Health Accommodation Form filled out by your healthcare provider (e.g., family doctor, psychologist, etc.). It helps us to better understand your needs when your healthcare provider provides examples of how the functional impact of your disability or condition is specifically addressed by the requested accommodation. Please note that disclosure of a diagnosis is optional and is not necessary to receive accommodations in residence.
We are unable to review requests that don’t include the Residence Health Accommodation Form (for example, requests that include supporting documentation only).
We review accommodation requests that are **required** to meet specific functional impacts stemming from your health condition. Needs must be explicitly identified and the Residence Admissions team will identify which rooms in our inventory can meet your requirements.
**Gender identity expression requests:** we rely on students to self-report. You may choose to submit information from a healthcare provider, but this is not mandatory.
**Creed/spiritual accommodation requests:** we rely on students to self-report. You may choose to submit documentation from a faith leader etc., but this is not mandatory.
**I am not sure if I need to submit an accommodation form.**
Please connect with our [Residence Support Coordinator](mailto:residencesupport@queensu.ca). If in doubt, submit a request.
Please note: to be eligible for a long bed you must be 6’ 4” or taller and you must submit the Residence Health Accommodation Form.
**How will my accommodation request be reviewed?**
We review all accommodation requests. If we are unable to approve the accommodation based on the provided documentation, we may ask for more information. We do not guarantee that all requests will be approved – for example, but not limited to, if you miss the deadline, the functional impacts are not adequately specified, and/or the provided information is incomplete.
**What happens if I submit my accommodation request after the application deadline?**
We will review all accommodation requests regardless of when they are submitted. However, we cannotguarantee in the case of late submissions that we will be able to process your request prior to self-selection or that you will have access to a room that meets your approved accommodation prior to move-in, or at any later point. We will continue to offer relevant bedspaces as they become available throughout the year. Please note that because we typically have a high occupancy rate, room availability can be limited and we cannot guarantee what room types will become available during the year, or when.
**I am requesting a single room with a semi-private washroom and would like to share the washroom with my friend.**
Single Plus rooms are not considered multi-occupancy rooms and so you cannot create a roommate group for Single Plus rooms. This extends to students requesting to share a washroom in the context of an approved accommodation.
**Can I submit an Individual Education Plan (IEP) or Psychoeducational Assessment?**
No. Please do not submit IEPs or Psychoeducational Assessments. We will not review these documents. If you require academic accommodations, please contact [Queen’s Student Accessibility Services](https://www.queensu.ca/studentwellness/accessibility-services) by emailing [qsas.intake@queensu.ca](mailto:qsas.intake@queensu.ca). Any requirement for accommodation specific to the residence living environment must be submitted on the appropriate residence forms.
**What do I do if I have a Service Animal?**
If you have a Service Animal you must register it through Queen’s Student Accessibility Services (QSAS) in accordance with the [Service Animals on Campus Policy](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/administration-and-operations/service-animals-campus-policy). Once you have registered your Service Animal through QSAS you will need to complete and sign the Service Animal Residence contract. Please review the [Residence Service Animal Guidelines](https://www.queensu.ca/residences/resources/policies#:~:text=Residence%20Service%20Animal%20Guidelines) for more information. You do not need to complete the Residence Health Accommodation Form.
In support of accessibility, the University may allow Service Animals in training on campus. However, Service Animals in training are not approved to live in Residences until their training is complete. To request permission to bring a Service Animal in training to campus, please contact the Department of [Environmental Health and Safety.](http://www.safety.queensu.ca/)
**What washroom types are available?**
If you require a washroom accommodation this must be specified on the Residence Health Accommodation Form, with appropriate supporting medical documentation. There are four washroom types across our 18 buildings:
* Private – washrooms are located within the bedroom space for exclusive use.
* Single-user – private washrooms that are not attached to the bedroom and are shared between all students on the floor. Only one student uses a private toilet or shower room at a time.
* Semi-private – washrooms are located between two single plus rooms and are shared between those two students only.
* Communal – washrooms are shared by a floor or wing. Multiple private shower and toilet stalls and communal sinks are shared between all students.
**What rooms will I see during self-selection?**
Students approved for an accommodation will typically take part in a separate self-selection. Our priority is for you to have access to a space that meets your approved accommodation. This means:
* You will not necessarily see all room types.
* You will see rooms in a range of residence buildings that can meet your approved accommodation. 
In some cases, we may need to manually place students with complex accommodation requirements. We will notify students if this is the case. 
**I want to be in a specific building as it is near my classes.**
Students approved for an accommodation will be provided with access to rooms that meet their approved accommodation. We do not grant requests to be in/near certain residence/campus buildings. 
If you are requesting an accommodation for mobility reasons, please ensure your healthcare provider has completed the relevant section of the Residence Health Accommodation Form. 
**How are accommodations determined?**
Residence health accommodations are determined based on the provided documentation outlining functional impacts.
Gender identity expression requests are determined based on your first-person experience of your identity. 
Creed/spiritual accommodations are determined in consultation with the Office of Faith and Spiritual Life as necessary.
Accommodations are assessed on a case-by-case basis. 
**How does the role of the parent/supporter/caregiver change from High School to post-secondary?**
The role of the parent/supporter/caregiver changes from leading to supporting. Parents don’t need to be involved in the accommodation process. This is an opportunity for the student to self-advocate for their needs and as such we encourage parents/supporters/caregivers to empower their student to take the lead in the accommodations process. Our team is able to speak with you only if your student has given their direct consent for us to speak with you about their accommodation request.
**How do I know my information will be kept private?**
Residence Admissions maintains student confidentiality. Information obtained will not be released without your consent, with the exception of cases where there is a concern of potential harm to self or others.

# [How to Comply with CASL](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/legal-counsel/casl/how-comply-casl) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/legal-counsel/casl/how-comply-casl_

1. Legal Counsel
2. Casl
3. How to Comply with CASL
## Content Requirements
CASL requires that **all CEMs** contain the following information:
1. the name of the Queen’s unit sending the message;
2. the mailing address, telephone number, email or web address for the Queen’s unit sending the message; and
3. information about how to unsubscribe from future CEMs.
The unsubscribe mechanism should be present at the bottom of all CEMs using language such as:
“You may unsubscribe from the Queen’s University \[insert name of list\] distribution list at any time by emailing \[insert email address\] or calling 613-533-6000 \[insert extension\].”
If a request to unsubscribe is received, the recipient must be removed from the distribution list **within 10 business days** of the request.
The following statement should be also be included in CEMs sent to internal recipients:
"You are receiving this message because you are a member of a subject specific internal email list generated by Queen’s University and/or you are in a pre-existing business relationship with Queen’s University. In either case, if you believe that you should not be a recipient, you may withdraw your consent to receive these messages at any time, in accordance with Canadian Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) and subject to Queen’s University policy, by contacting the sender of this message.
Please be aware that messages to Queen’s University employees and students, sent for the purpose of conducting regular non-commercial University business, are not governed by CASL."
## Consent Requirements
Prior to sending a CEM, a sender must have received the consent of the recipient. Consent may be express or implied.
### Express Consent
Express consent occurs where the recipient has provided oral or written consent to receive electronic messages and remains in effect until the recipient unsubscribes from future messages.
### Implied Consent
Implied consent occurs where the recipient has:
* an existing business relationship with Queen’s in the preceding two years;
* an existing non-business relationship (i.e., donors, alumni, volunteers) with Queen’s in the preceding two years; or
* conspicuously published their business contact information **AND** the recipient has not indicated a wish not to receive unsolicited CEMs; and your message is relevant to the recipient's business, role, functions or duties in a business or official capacity.
### Tracking Consent and Unsubscriptions
Compliance with CASL includes implementing systems to track recipient consents and giving effect to requests to unsubscribe. Tracking systems can be as simple as a spreadsheet or as complex as an integrated database. Regardless of the system, the sender must be able to document addresses which have provided express consent and those which have unsubscribed.
Where a sender is relying on implied consent to send CEMs, the tracking system must be able to track the “expiry” dates of the implied consent categories. Implied consent normally lasts for two years so, to take advantage, Queen’s entities planning on relying on implied consent to send CEMs should seek express consent as soon as possible.
### How to Obtain Express Consent
Electronic messages requesting express consent under CASL are also considered to be CEMs. Unless the proposed CEM fits into one of the exemptions discussed above, the CEM should not be sent or the information should be delivered in an alternate format (such as by direct mail or a telephone campaign). However, requests for express consent can be sent where the recipient has provided their implied consent (as outlined above). Through this process, implied consent is “converted” into express consent.
Requests for express consent must contain the following information:
1. The specific purpose for which express consent is requested;
2. The name of the Queen’s unit seeking consent;
3. The mailing address and telephone number, email address or web address for the Queen’s unit seeking consent (or a link to a website containing this information); and
4. A statement indicating that consent can be withdrawn at any time.
If you are collecting personal information (such as an individual’s name, address and telephone number), the request for consent must also include a privacy statement containing the following information:
1. The reason that the information is being collected;
2. The legal authority for collecting the information;
3. The contact number for a Queen’s employee.
A sample privacy statement is provided below:
“Personal information is collected under the authority of the _Queen’s University Royal Charter, 1841, as amended_, and will be used for educational, administrative and statistical purposes.  Questions regarding the collection or use of this personal information should be directed to \[Title, Address, Telephone Number, (Email)\].”

## Exam Communications
The Exams Office is committed to keeping students informed about important dates, processes, and deadlines impacting examinations.
In order to help you get the information you need to fully prepare for your exams, we invite you to review the messages that have been e-mailed to students, as well as their contents:
**The Fall 2024 Exam Schedule is now available in the SOLUS Student Centre.** 
  **Please read all the following information carefully.**
  **Where do I find the schedule?**
* Students can view their exam schedule in the SOLUS Student Centre by selecting the “Exam Schedule” tile. It contains both the times and on-campus locations of each exam session. These instructions are also available online here. 
* If you have an exam that is NOT listed in SOLUS, please contact your instructor for clarification, as this would mean that the exam is not being administered by the Exams Office.
**Before you write…** 
Before you arrive to write your exam, please be aware of the following rules:
* If you are sick on the day of your examination: It is recommended that students who are ill on the day of an examination not write the exam. Such students should seek health services, if needed, and follow up with their home Faculty/School.
* Students who experience an unexpected illness during an examination must notify a proctor prior to leaving so the student’s home Faculty/School can be informed of the event with an incident report. When students leave an examination without notifying a proctor of an unexpected illness, it will be assumed that they completed the exam. 
* All exam venues are scent-free. Please refrain from wearing scented products, including perfume or cologne, to your exam.
* Once arriving at the exam hall, please review the blackboard/whiteboard to determine which room(s) your exam is in. Please congregate near, but DO NOT ENTER that room. If all rooms are hosting the same exam, you may congregate in the general area. The proctors will direct students into the room at the appropriate time.
* Please ensure you bring only items required for your exam as all other personal belongings, including all bags, must be left in the hallway. Queen’s University assumes no responsibility for lost or stolen items.
* Students may wear their coats into the exam venue, and they may be placed on the back of the chair. If for any reason the coat impedes traffic in the aisle behind the chair, students will be required to adjust the placement of the coat to ensure safety standards are met. Proctors may advise students of impediments, and students are to follow the direction of the proctors regarding coat placement.
* Please ensure you have visited the restroom and have all your required items before entering the exam hall. Once admitted to the exam hall prior to the exam beginning, students will not be allowed to exit the hall until after the first half hour of the exam (e.g., 9:30 / 2:30 / 7:30).
* You will need your Student Photo ID Card to gain admittance to the exam hall. A $50.00 fine will be applied to those who do not bring their card.

_Senate Member Composition_
_Ex officio_ are full voting members with all the same rights and responsibilities as elected members
A summary of the historical development of the Senate, [The Evolution of Composition and Function of the Senate, 1842-1995](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/node/923), by Margaret Hooey, former Secretary of the Senate.
(approved by Senate April 28, 2011, amended January 31, 2017)
## Central Function:
1. Under the jurisdiction of the Royal Charter of 1841, Senate determines all matters of an academic character that affect the University as a whole, and is concerned with all matters that affect the general welfare of the University and its constituents. Senate shall serve as a forum for discussion and exchange of ideas among the members of the University community.
## Academic Planning and Educational Environment Functions:
_Senate will_
2. participate in strategic planning for the University, including but not limited to the budgetary process and campus planning and development.
 
3. assume a shared responsibility, along with the Board of Trustees and the Administration of Queen's, for a living and learning environment that promotes the well-being of students.
 
4. commit through policies and programs to an environment at the University that recognizes equity and diversity as being vital to, and in harmony with, its educational purposes and standards of excellence as an institution.
 
## Legislative Functions:
_Senate has the authority to_
5. approve the establishment or closure of any academic unit, centre or institute, subject to ratification by the Board of Trustees.
 
6. approve the establishment or closure of named and funded chairs and professorships, subject to ratification by the Board of Trustees.
 
7. approve the establishment or closure, on the recommendation of Faculty Boards and Schools, of all programs of study leading to a degree, diploma, or certificate, and review all such programs cyclically.
 
8. approve university-level policies relating to the academic mission and academic services including but not limited to policies related to admissions, calendars, examinations, student financial aid, and annual enrolment planning.
 
9. grant all honorary degrees and grant on the recommendation of Faculty Boards and Schools all earned degrees, diplomas, and certificates awarded by the University.
 
10. approve policies and procedures regarding student academic matters, and to discipline students with respect to departures from academic integrity, including the power to require a student to withdraw from the university. Senate maintains a concern for matters of student non-academic misconduct and participates in the Board of Trustee’s governance of non-academic misconduct discipline structures.
 
11. approve the Academic Plan and the Strategic Research Plan.
 
## Appointment/Selection Functions:
_Senate will_
12. share with the Board of Trustees the responsibility for the selection of the Principal through a committee composed equally of members of the Senate and the Board.
 
13. establish the procedures to be followed in the appointments of Deans and academic Vice-Principals.
 
14. appoint, establish terms of reference, and have responsibility for committees that fulfill the functions of Senate. 
 
Queen’s Senate is one of the three governing bodies of the university, together with the Board of Trustees and University Council, all of which are administered by the University Secretariat.  The Senate is chaired by the Principal and Vice-Chancellor, and its membership includes faculty, students, staff, and university administrators.
Along with the Board, the creation of [Senate](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/senate/senate "Senate") is described in Queen’s Royal Charter from 1841: “…so soon as there shall be a Principal and one Professor in the said College, the Board of Trustees shall have the authority to constitute…a Court to be called ‘The College Senate’, for the exercise of Academical superintendence …” (Royal Charter, s. 23).
In the present day, the Senate is the university’s highest academic governing body.  It is governed by its [Rules of Procedure](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/senate/rules-procedure-senate "Rules of Procedure of the Senate"), which exist in concert with the Royal Charter and other applicable governance documents.  The Senate has 68 members: 12 ex-officio and 56 elected.
### Senators’ Responsibilities
It is the expectation that senators will act in good faith in the best interests of the university as a whole, regardless of the constituency from which they were elected, when discussing and voting on matters before them. This necessitates a level of advance preparation that, at a minimum, would include reviewing relevant information included in the Senate agenda package, but also asking questions where any portion of a proposal is unclear, including how it will impact the future development of the University and the achievement of its strategic goals.
i) **Meetings**:  As a senator, engagement in the work of the Senate is integral to a successful experience.  Senate meetings normally occur three times in the fall term and four times in the winter term for approximately one and a half to two hours at a time.  Senators can expect to see items such as, but not limited to, program modifications or creations, cyclical program reviews, reports from administration, committee reports, COU reports, proposed Honorary Degree recipients, and questions posed in advance by senators.  Questions may also be asked of any item during Senate meetings.
Comprehensive orientation sessions are offered early in the fall term for new and returning senators, and an [online Senate orientation module](https://rise.articulate.com/share/HSqcgML8HaNUKyDKwg3m8--AVn8bnQxb#/) is always available on the Secretariat’s website.  Accommodations to attend meetings are available in coordination with the Secretariat.
It is critical that all senators feel comfortable participating fully in a Senate meeting and that debate takes place in an atmosphere of respect, trust, inclusion, collegiality, and fairness.  Senators should be committed to actively generating an environment of inclusion for the full participation of everyone.
Senators should consider that all members interact as equals during meetings and must feel welcome to freely express their thoughts and opinions on matters under debate.
ii) **Agenda Packages**: Senate agenda packages are published one week in advance of Senate meetings and range in size depending on the items being brought to the Senate for its review.  Senators should stay informed and devote time to being well-prepared for meetings to ensure effective decision-making processes.
While senators are encouraged to review the entire package, this may not always be possible.  Items coming to the Senate from committees typically include an executive summary.  Reviewing these should be considered the minimum level of preparedness to be completed by senators in advance of each meeting.
All agenda packages are available to the public on [Queen’s Governance Portal](https://queensuniversity.civicweb.net/Portal/).
iii) **Committees**:  The Senate is supported by 10 standing committees, which conduct a variety of work related to academic development and program review, the Senate’s governance, scholarships and student aid, libraries, research, educational equity, and student orientation.  Committee meetings usually take place two to four times in each of the fall and winter terms.  Each committee chair provides a short, written report to the Senate after committee meetings to ensure that senators are aware of the business being conducted by Senate committees.
All senators are strongly encouraged to serve on at least one Senate committee during their term on Senate as it will enrich your understanding and appreciation of the work performed through the committee structure and enhance your knowledge of the University’s governance and administrative decision-making structures.  Senators are welcome to reach out to the Secretariat to discuss committees in the context of the diversity of their qualifications, skills, expertise, and knowledge.
iv) **Time Commitment**:  Based on meeting schedules and other duties, senators can expect an average monthly time commitment from September to May of four to six hours.
v) **Board-Senate Retreat**:  A joint retreat for the Senate and Board of Trustees takes place in March each year and usually occurs on a Saturday afternoon.  The retreat provides an opportunity for senators and trustees to discuss current matters of strategic interest to both governing bodies, and fosters greater collaboration in shaping the future direction of the university.  It also provides an opportunity to foster a positive culture of shared governance based on collegiality, inclusion, and dialogue.
The retreat is organized around a theme and participants identify and prioritize matters to be recommended for study and implementation by the university’s administration.
vi) **Receptions**: In addition to meetings and the Retreat, senators are invited to attend an annual social Senate Reception in the fall term.  Student senators and student observers are also invited to attend an annual lunch with the Principal in late March/early April.
vii) **Surveys**: To assist with ongoing improvements to Senate’s effectiveness and senator engagement, senators are asked to complete a short annual Senate effectiveness survey administered in the winter term.  In addition, if they have not already completed it as part of their faculty, student, or staff role, senators are also asked to complete a brief equity census in the fall term to assist with efforts related to Senate’s Indigenization, equity, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility.  Results from both surveys are reported to the Senate.

# [Appeal Process | Office of the University Ombudsperson](https://www.queensu.ca/ombuds/appeal-process/appeal-process) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/ombuds/appeal-process/appeal-process_

Academic Regulations at Queen’s University were designed to ensure that students are being treated fairly and equitably while upholding the academic standards of the institution. 
On occasion, there are circumstances that are usually beyond a student’s control that may have impacted their performance at Queen’s. Appeal processes were developed to reconsider the appropriateness of any sanctions or penalties that may have been imposed upon a student. Typically for any appeal process, there are limited grounds for filing an appeal, which could include extenuating circumstances or significant procedural irregularity. 
Review the rules and regulations of your Faculty or School to ensure your circumstances meet the ground(s) for appeal.

# [Fall Fun | School of Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs](https://www.queensu.ca/grad-postdoc/graduate-studies/gradifying-blog/fall-fun) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/grad-postdoc/graduate-studies/gradifying-blog/fall-fun_

As I feel the cold crisp morning air, hear the leaves crunch under my feet, and reach for my favorite cozy sweater, I am reminded that Fall has arrived. For this week’s Gradifying Blog, I want to share some of my fall favorites with you, along with a few new things I hope to explore as the season unfolds.
* [‘Spooky’ Movies at the Screening Room:](https://screeningroomkingston.com/) This October, our favorite independent movie theater has a fantastic spooky line up. First up, is a [Silent Movie Weekend](https://screeningroomkingston.com/movies/silent-movie-weekend-the-phantom-carriage-keaton-lloyd/): On Oct 11 at 7pm, they are screening the Swedish Horror: The Phantom Carriage (1921) directed by Victor Sjöström and on October 12 at 1pm, the Comedy Matinee is Our Hospitality (1923) starring and directed by Buster Keaton preceded by the short film Never Weaken (1921) starring Harold Lloyd. What makes these screenings so special is that they have a live improvised piano accompaniment by [Bruce Vogt.](https://www.brucevogt.com/)  If you enjoy witches, and love 90s cult classics, check out the double feature of [Practical Magic (1998) and The Craft (1996](https://screeningroomkingston.com/movies/90s-witches-double-feature-practical-magic-the-craft/)) on October 24 and 27 at 6:30. This event includes trivia, prizes and margaritas. Lastly, from Oct 22 – 31 they are screening the cult classic, [Rocky Horror Picture Show](https://screeningroomkingston.com/movies/the-rocky-horror-picture-show-1975/) where audience participation, props, and costumes are highly encouraged. Fun fact, my partner and I once won best costume as Janet & Brad. Rocky Horror Picture Show isn’t a film you can watch at home on your computer, it must be experience in person, with a theater full of people who have a passion for the film.
* [Free Self-Guided Walking Tours](https://www.visitkingston.ca/walking-tours/film/): I have a furry family member named Charlie (who many of you have met) and we love to walk! This fall, we hope to try some of Kingston’s Free Self-Guided Walking Tours including Film, Literary, and Music Tours. As a Ph.D. student in the Film and Media Department I am planning to start with the Film Tour to learn a little more about my department’s history. And since it is October, I am looking forward to hearing how Dan Aykroyd’s great-grandfather’s séance in Kingston during the 1920’s inspired the movie, Ghost Busters. Of course, we will watch the movie following the tour!
* [Fruition Berry Farm:](https://www.fruition.ca/serviceslist) Last October, Q Move Crew and SGSPA took a school bus full of grad students to Fruition Berry Farm. It felt just like a school field trip, and it was just as fun! I came home covered in mud with a large $10 bouquet of sunflowers. It is a Queen’s memory I will always cherish. The farm offers good, wholesome, fall fun including wagon rides, pumpkin picking and their legendary corn maze. This year’s corn maze is full of CORNnections puzzles which are word puzzles that must be solved at each check point. The farm is a 20-minute drive from Kingston, is open Saturdays and Sundays from 10am to 4 pm until October 27th. Last admission is at 3:30 PM. The cost is affordable at $6 per adult or $3.50 for groups of 15 or more.
* [Waddell Apples - Orchard & Farm Store](https://www.waddellapples.ca/): Picking apples sounds like the perfect fall afternoon activity. You can Pick Your Own Apples, with medium bags (holding over 10 lbs) available for $20, and large bags (holding over 20 lbs) for $40. Between the store and the Pick Your Own Apples, they have 15 varieties of apples available including many unique ones such as Lobo, Shamrock, Sweet Tango, Cortland, Empire, Macoun, Liberty, Crimson Crisp, Idared and Nova Spy.  Their local farm store is in an 1830’s log cabin and has a many of my favorite fall treats including, Apple Fruit Leather, Fresh Pressed Apple Cider, Apple Pie and Butter Tarts. Yum! Waddell Apple Orchard is a 20-minute drive from Kingston and is open daily 10am -4 pm.
Whether you’re catching a spooky movie, getting lost in a corn maze, or picking the perfect apple, bundle up and enjoy all that Kingston has to offer this fall.

## Research, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Resources at Queen’s

# [Employee Resource Groups | Vice Principal (Culture, Equity and Inclusion)](https://www.queensu.ca/vpcei/initiatives/employee-resource-groups) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/vpcei/initiatives/employee-resource-groups_

## Purpose
Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) help create an inclusive workplace by giving equity-deserving groups a formal structure within an organization to support their unique needs. ERGs contribute to community building within organizations and provide an avenue for all employees to learn more about diverse groups. 
ERGs provide professional development opportunities to develop skills such as project management, budget development, public speaking and committee organization which are directly transferable to the workplace. Activities such as Annual General Meetings, educational workshops, social events and website development, among others, support employee professional development. ERG commitments typically range from five to ten hours per month for ERG organizers, less for ERG participants. [\[1\]](https://www.queensu.ca/vpcei/sites/vpceiwww/files/uploaded_images/20150716-ccdi-report-erg-toolkit.pdf)
 [ERG Needs Assessment and Website Review](https://www.queensu.ca/vpcei/sites/vpceiwww/files/uploaded_files/2023-12-21_ERG%20Needs%20Assessment.pdf "Employee Resource Group Needs Assessment and Website Review") (PDF 2MB)
## Equity-Deserving Groups
Equity-deserving groups are communities that face significant collective challenges in participating in society. Their marginalization may be caused by attitudinal, historic, social, and environmental barriers based on characteristics including, but not limited to, age, ethnicity, disability, economic status, gender, nationality, race, faith, sexual orientation, and transgender status. Equity-deserving groups identify barriers to equal access, opportunities, and resources due to discrimination and subsequent disadvantage, and actively seek social justice and reparation. [\[2\]](#ftn2)
## Funding Applications
The Vice-Principal (Culture, Equity, and Inclusion), in partnership with Human Resources (HR) and the Human Rights and Equity Office (HREO), provides support for ERGs working to build and support communities for equity-deserving groups on campus. 
ERGs may [apply for funding](https://queensu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_01EGTUlnmSL3exo) of up to $1,000 per fiscal year (May 1 to April 30) from the Employee Resource Group Fund. Funding requests will be considered by the Vice-Principal (Culture, Equity, and Inclusion). ERGs may also be eligible for additional funding through the [Inclusive Community Fund](https://www.queensu.ca/vpcei/initiatives/inclusive-community-fund).
To receive funding, ERGs must submit an application which demonstrates that the ERG:
* Works to advance the interests of equity-deserving groups on campus.
 
* Is sponsored by a faculty or administrative unit.
 
 [ERG Application Form](https://www.queensu.ca/vpcei/sites/vpceiwww/files/uploaded_files/ERG-Application-Form.pdf) (PDF 118.9 KB)

### Supervisors and Managers
Due to the important role ERGs play in advancing the university’s commitment to creating an inclusive environment, supervisors/managers should promote employee involvement in ERGs, and are strongly encouraged to support specific employee requests to participate in ERG events and programming whenever possible. 
To facilitate the success of ERGs, supervisors/managers should:
* Raise awareness of ERGs for current and new employees.
 
* Work collaboratively with employees to develop mutually agreeable plans to allow time for ERG participation while supporting the delivery of core operational responsibilities and timelines.
 
* Provide employees adequate time, during work hours where operationally possible, to participate in ERG activities and/or to organize and conduct ERG business including planning, organization, mentorship, advocacy, etc. for their groups. If required, this may include adjusting work deliverables, if possible, or reviewing flexible or alternate work arrangements. Depending on the activity or ERG role, this may be a few hours at one time, or one to two hours per week on an ongoing basis.
 
* Communicate to employees wanting to participate in ERG activities the expectations for prior approval to attend events or lead the organization of ERGs if required for operational planning. Given the sensitive and personal nature of some ERG related identities, managers shall not require employees to inform them of which ERG they are a part of, or the details of the events they are participating in.
 
* Promote ERG events as appropriate to all staff as learning and development opportunities.
 
* Provide access to appropriate resources for employees to participate in ERG activities, for example the temporary use of private work location or a computer.
 
* Recognize the service contribution of employees who participate in ERGs as part of the annual performance planning process.
 
### Employees
To facilitate ERG participation, achievement of professional development goals and recognition of service contribution balanced against operational requirements, employees should:
If appropriate given the employees’ working arrangements:
* Speak with their manager in advance to request time to participate in ERG activities during working hours. Employees are encouraged to provide their manager with details of the type of work or ERG they are working on, when comfortable, but are not required to do so if they would like to protect this piece of their identity.
 
* Share information on ERG activities with their manager where appropriate, and as comfortable, so they are aware of the how this contributes to professional development and provides opportunities to develop transferable skills.
 
* Consider life and work responsibilities and set reasonable individual expectations and boundaries for participation in ERGs.
 
* Work collaboratively with managers to develop mutually agreeable plans to allow time for ERG participation while supporting the delivery of core operational responsibilities and timelines.    
 
* * *

# [Academic Accommodations and Online Exams | Accessibility Services](https://www.queensu.ca/studentwellness/accessibility-services/academic-accommodations-online-exams) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/studentwellness/accessibility-services/academic-accommodations-online-exams_

1. [Queen's Student Accessibility Services (QSAS)](https://www.queensu.ca/studentwellness/accessibility-services)
2. Academic Accommodations
Academic accommodations are designed to remove barriers to higher education while upholding essential requirements. Academic accommodations are provided by considering:
* the students first-person experience.
* medical documentation.
* academic programming. 
Students registered with QSAS may receive permanent or interim accommodations.
## Duration
Interim accommodations are provided to students who, at the moment of registering with QSAS, do not have documentation that meets [QSAS Documentation Criteria](https://www.queensu.ca/studentwellness/accessibility-services/documentation-requirements-forms), but who have documentations demonstrating a need for removing barriers to education. 
Interim accommodations expire at the end of the next academic term. 
Students requiring permanent accommodations need to provide documentation meeting the **[QSAS Documentation Criteria](https://www.queensu.ca/studentwellness/accessibility-services/documentation-requirements-forms)** before interim accommodations have expired. 
Permanent accommodations expire on August 31st, five (5) years from the end of the academic year (Sept. 1-Aug. 31) they were implemented. 
Students are **not required** to meet with a QSAS Advisor to discuss accommodations each semester however, students are **encouraged** to book a meeting if there have been changes to medical information and/or program of study. 
There may be a time in the university experience in which retroactive accommodations must be considered due to a disability related experience. In accordance with the [**Ontario Human Rights Commission**](https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-accessible-education-students-disabilities) (_**sec. 8.3.4 - Accommodation after a deadline, test or course has been completed**_), Queen’s University considers retroactive accommodations on a case-by-case basis.
Retroactive accommodations will be considered based on the following grounds:
* Student discovers after the fact that their academic performance had been impacted by a condition they were unaware of at the time
* Student was aware of their accommodation needs but they were unable to participate in the university accommodation process at the time due to their condition
* Student did not have prior warning of an accommodation need
* * *
## Related Services, Supports, & Technologies
Student may experience barriers to writing tests, quizzes, or exams for disability related reasons.
Instructors and/or faculty contacts are responsible for deciding how to best support deferral requests. An exam deferral may not always be possible, and instructors may offer alternative academic options in lieu of a deferral. 
* * *
#### Students requesting an exam deferral should follow the outlined procedure:
* Email your instructor or faculty contact, notifying them that you are requesting an Exam Deferral for reasons related to your disability for which you are registered with QSAS. Copy your QSAS Advisor on the email. 
* If the exam is being written through the Exam's Office, withdraw the assessment in [Ventus](https://www.queensu.ca/studentwellness/accessibility-services/ventus). Failure to withdraw and/or appear for an accommodated assessment may result in $45 charge per missed assessment. 
* * *
#### Instructors and Faculty:
* Please do not ask this student to apply for Academic Consideration. 
* Please let the student know that you received their request, and provide information about next steps: 
 * a date and time to write their deferred exam. 
 * an alternative academic option if a deferral is not feasibly possible.  
* * *
#### Multiple Exam Deferral Requests:
If an instructor and/or faculty member is concerned about students who are making multiple exam deferral requests, please reach out to their Accessibility Advisor.
* * *
#### Denial of Exam Deferrals and Academic Implications
Where a deferral is not academically feasible or appropriate, instructors should offer alternative academic options. Students are encouraged to communicate directly with their instructors or their faculty academic advisors about the academic implications associated with an exam deferral. 
QSAS works closely with the [Exams Office](https://www.queensu.ca/registrar/academic-info/exams/students) [](https://www.queensu.ca/registrar/academic-info/exams/students)to ensure students receive their accommodated exams. Students are encouraged to become familiar with information on their website such as deadlines to register for accommodations, accommodated exam scheduling, and cancellation policy.  
Any **changes** to **assessment accommodations** must be **made** a **minimum of 10 days prior to the exam date.**  Changes will not be accepted past this deadline. Students requiring a revision to their approved accommodations, need to book an appointment with their Accessibility Advisor using the “Book Now” button found in Ventus.
Assessment accommodations are communicated with Exams Office through Ventus. For questions directly related to accommodations as specified in the "assessment" tab, please contact exams@queensu.ca.

* [Inspiration](https://guides.library.queensu.ca/adaptive-technology-centre/atc/inspiration) - used for creating concept maps, mind maps, diagrams, graphic organizers, outlines and presentations.
* [EquatIO](https://guides.library.queensu.ca/adaptive-technology-centre/-equatio) - allows you to create equations, formulas, and more, digitally and accessibly.
* * *
Students are encouraged to visit the [Adaptive Technology Centre](https://library.queensu.ca/help-services/accessibility/hardware-and-software-available-adaptive-technology-centre) website for information and support on accessing and using the above adaptive software programs.
Note-Taking accommodations are provided using Glean for Education – an audio note-taker support that allows students to record lectures, annotate and tag the recorded lecture, and create transcripts of the audio recorded lecture to support creation of study notes. Your QSAS Accessibility Advisor will be able to provide you with an invitation to use this software.
* * *
Note-taking accommodations may be approved for students with:
* Hearing loss, e.g. difficulties hearing the instructor while writing notes at the same time
* Vision loss, e.g. difficulties seeing information presented on overhead screens
* Mental health conditions or attention-related disabilities, e.g. difficulties sustaining attention or attending to orally-presented information while taking notes
* Learning disabilities, e.g. difficulties recording notes when information is presented orally
* Physical disabilities, e.g. motor- or pain-related difficulties, broken wrists or arms
* * *
When approving note-taking as an accommodation, QSAS considers a combination of:
* Student expression of need for note-taking – as related to a specific educational barrier being experienced
* Information contained in their provided medical documentation
* Type and/or structure of course
### Time for stretch, rest, or restroom breaks
Students will receive extra time on their exams to allow for these breaks without impacting their writing time. Students are expected to self-monitor their break time during the exam. Additional time for breaks will not be provided for exams with open time restrictions (e.g., 24-hours to complete a 3-hour exam).
* Students may be permitted to use noise cancelling headphones or earplugs while completing exams.
* Students are permitted to listen to music while completing online exams.
* Students must observe any restrictions instituted by their instructors about accessing information outside of the online platform being used for their exam, including information on smartphones or other devices.
* * *
### Restricted Screen Use
Students with recent concussions and other injuries may be restricted in their use of computers or screens. For some exams, students can view the exam questions online, but write their answers by hand on paper. They can then photograph their handwritten answers and submit pictures. Instructors should inform students how to submit their exam answers using this method.
Students writing exams for which this approach is not feasible should contact their QSAS advisor. Other accommodations, such as a Reader and/or Scribe, may be available.
### Extra Time Accommodations
Extra time will be provided to students on increments of 15-minutes on the hour (e.g., 15, 30, 45, or 60 minutes/hour).
* * *
### Other Assessment Accommodations
Extra Time Between Final Exams
* May include a maximum of one exam per calendar day or 24-hours between start of exams.
 * Students should review their final exam schedule in SOLUS. If an exam contradicts this accommodation, students must email their instructor or faculty contact person and QSAS Advisor immediately
Time of Day Restriction
* May include restricting exams at a certain time of day – morning, afternoon, or evening
Split Exams for Time Restricted Exams
* Considering academic requirements and test design, the instructor splits the exam into 2-parts that each require approximately the same amount of time to complete
* * *
### Types of Timed Assessments
Regular Timed Assessments
* Students will receive either 15, 30, 45, or 60 extra minutes/hour of writing time
Regular Timed Assessments with Restricted Open/Closed Periods
* Exam within a given window of time (e.g., a 3-hour exam that can be written at any time within a 24-hour period)
* Students with assessment accommodations receive extra time for the exam writing of the exam
* Students with assessment accommodations will receive the same window of time (e.g., in the example above, 24-hour period) to complete the exam as all other students
Extended Timed Assessments or Take-Home Exams
* On exams where the instructor has provided extended time (e.g., 72 hours to complete an exam with base time of 3-hours), no extra time will be provided to a student with an extra time accommodation as the expectation is that the extended period of time has removed barriers.
* * *
### Who May Receive Assessment Accommodations?
Extra time can be used to address several barriers, including:
* **Reading or information processing** where a student requires more time to read exam questions for comprehension
* **Written expression** where a student requires more time to formulate and articulate responses
* **Mental health** where a student requires more time to incorporate strategies for symptom management, such as calming or breathing techniques
* **Chronic pain, concussions, or other physical impacts** where pain may slow cognition and focus
* **Attention deficit, concussions, or other neurodiverse impacts** which may interfere with concentration and focus
* **Vision loss** where a student requires more time to use adaptive technology or individualized support (e.g., reader or scribe) to access exam content and/or communicate responses
* **Medical needs** where a student requires more time to monitor things such blood sugar levels or pain
* **Temporary injuries**, such as hand or arm injuries, where a student requires more time to physically write responses
* * *
### Universal Design & Extra Time
* Extra time on a quiz, test, or exam is determined from the base time of the exam, not on the extended time provided by an instructor to everyone in the course, also known as universal extra time.
 * Ex. The exam may have a base time of 60 minutes and the instructor provides 30 minutes of universal extra time meaning the time to complete the exam is 90 minutes for all students
* Students will receive accommodated extra time on the base time (in the example above, that would be 60 minutes), and not on the amount of universal extra time provided (in the example above, that would be 90 minutes)
* If the **universal extra time is greater than or equal to the amount of extra time** a student would receive with their extra time accommodation, then the student will be provided with the universal extra time only.
 * In the example above, if the student receives extra time accommodation of either 15 mins/hour or 30 mins/hour, then they would be provided with the universal extra time of 90 minutes
* If the **universal extra time is less than the amount of extra time** a student would receive with their extra time accommodation, then the student will be provided with the accommodated extra time – determined from the base time of the exam, not the universal extra time.
 * In the example above, if the student receives extra time accommodation of either 45 mins/hour or 60 mins/hour, then they would be provided with their accommodated extra time – 105 mins or 120 mins.
* Students with additional exam accommodations such as adaptive technology or private room will still be provided with these accommodations, regardless of universal extra time.
Instructors should prepare their exam materials using an [accessible format](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/tutorials/what-are-alternate-formats) that enables students to enlarge the materials or access them using built-in computer features or adaptive software.
* Instructors should avoid using scanned images in exam materials even for online exams wherever possible (e.g., uploaded pictures taken by cell phones, or other devices).
 * These are not easily enlarged without reducing image quality. Also, they are frequently inaccessible to students using adaptive software.
The Adaptive Technology Centre provides helpful guidance on [creating accessible documents](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/how-info/accessible-documents).
This accommodation refers to information that students, whose memory retrieval is impaired, are permitted to bring and use during an exam/midterm/in-class test/quiz.
There are two types of memory aids:
* Cue Sheet – a document containing information that serves as “triggers” to help cue a student’s recollection of previously learned information.
* Formula Sheet – a document containing formula (i.e., set of rules or principles that are expressed using symbols, figures, or both). Students are permitted a formula sheet only on exams/tests that assess students on their application, as opposed to recollection, of formula.
A memory aid accommodation is not:
* A substitute for studying or exemption from mastering course material
* Answers to exam or test questions, a study or answer sheet
* Course notes or copies of course slides
* Lists of specific facts, details, or concepts upon which students are being tested for their recollection
This accommodation appears in Ventus as: Permission to bring and use a memory aid as pre-approved by the instructor. "Cue Sheet," "Formula Sheet," or both will be specified on the student's letter.
All memory aids must be reviewed and approved by instructors.
* * *
### Who Can Receive this Accommodation?
Students with neurological impairment that interferes with their spontaneous retrieval of learned information may be approved for this accommodation.
Students seeking this accommodation must provide the following documentation:
1. Validated measures of performance validity
2. Memory assessment that:
 * Demonstrates actual learning took place
 * Requires the student to recall the learned information after a standardized period of time
 * Confirms that the student failed to retrieve the learned information
 * Confirms that the student could recall it when given cues
 * Confirms that the difference between the student’s spontaneous recollection and cued recollection is significantly larger than it is for other students (e.g., normed comparisons)
Low scores on measures of “working memory” and “auditory working memory” are not sufficient evidence to support the need for a memory aid accommodation. Working memory does not require actual storage of information. Auditory working memory does not require the transferral of temporarily held information into long-term storage.
Students and their health care providers are encouraged to consult the guidelines for memory aids prepared by the [Regional Assessment & Resource Centre.](https://www.queensu.ca/rarc/research) These guidelines detail information about assessments and measures that should be administered in support of this accommodation at Queen’s University.
* * *
### How Does This Accommodation Work?
* Students approved for this accommodation are encouraged to **email academic.success@queensu.ca** to book an appointment with the QSAS Learning Strategist, for guidance on how to create a memory aid
* Student must submit their memory aid to their instructor for review and approval at least **10 business days**\* in advance of the exam/test/midterm.
* **Instructors are within their right to disallow** a student the use of a memory aid that presents any risk to academic integrity, or if they were not given sufficient time for review.
\*_For Spring, Summer and/or other condensed terms or courses, the student and professor may need to negotiate a different but reasonable timeline for review of the memory aid in time for scheduled tests, midterms, or exams._
* * *
### Steps in Preparing for the Memory Aid Accommodation
Mid-terms, in-class tests, or quizzes administered by the instructor or TA
* Student creates and submits the memory aid to instructor **10 business days** in advance of the exam date.
* Instructor reviews, approves and signs the memory aid; **returns it to the student.**
* Student brings the original signed memory aid to the exam.
Mid-terms, tests, quizzes, and final exams administered by the Exam's Office
* Student creates and submits the memory aid to instructor **10 business days** in advance of the exam date.
* Instructor reviews, approves, signs, and sends approved memory aid **directly to the Exams Office**
The approved memory aid, along with all other exam materials, is provided to the student in the accommodated exam venue.
Students approved for this accommodation face barriers which significantly restrict their ability to read text during exams.
* * *

* Remote support of these accommodations may be provided by a teaching assistant or other suitable Queen's individual through Microsoft Teams or Zoom.
* * *
### Scribe Qualifications
A scribe is a qualified individual who writes or types verbatim exactly as a student dictates their responses during exams. Instructors, teaching assistants, graduate and upper-year students, proctors, or administrative staff may serve as qualified scribes.
Qualified scribes must be able to:
* Handwrite in clear and legible manner
* Type at a reasonably efficient speed
* Maintain a neutral facial expression and posture without giving hints of any kind
* Sit quietly while students process their answers
* Work with students comfortably and compatibly without creating unnecessary pressure, expectations, or distractions

 * Must prompt the student if they neglect to specify where to place figures and operands for responses requiring equations
 * Must make any changes the student requests, even if they are mathematically incorrect
* **Must not** assist the student in any way (i.e., suggesting answers, offering strategies or clues, indicating correct or incorrect answers, or instructing the student to redo or review any part of their answer or exam)
Students may receive the ability to write their exams in a [semi-private](https://www.queensu.ca/studentwellness/sites/swswww/files/uploaded_files/QSAS_Files/exam-rooms/Semi-Private%20Space%20-%20Mitchell%20Hall.jpg) room within the Exam’s Centre.
These accommodations may be provided to students using adaptive technology that requires a private space (e.g., text-to-speech or speech-to-text software) or students who with visual or auditory attention concerns.
* Students receive **up to** 7-calendar day extension on assignments
 * Students can submit their assignment any time before the end of the requested extension period.
 * The requested extension period will start at the end of any late submission grace period that may be provided by the instructor.
* Students are responsible for communicating the extension via email to their instructor **prior to the assignment due date** and can use the suggested [email template](https://www.queensu.ca/studentwellness/sites/swswww/files/uploaded_files/Up%20to%207-Day%20Extension%20on%20Assignments.pdf "Up to 7-Day Extension on Assignment Email Template"). 
 * This email should not contain personal medical information.
 * Requests made after the due date will be considered on an individual basis, but may not be able to be provided.
* Extensions beyond 7 calendar days may be provided under _unique circumstances_. The extension will be considered by QSAS in connection with the course instructor.
 * _Unique circumstances_ are newly arising barriers related to functional impacts that were either unknown or unanticipated when the original extension was provided.  This could also be related to a significant change to prognosis or status.
 * If an additional extension is requested, the request must be made prior to the end of the original extension.
 * Requests made after the original extension will be considered on an individual basis, but may not be able to be provided.
* Given the nature of the structure of some classes, there may be assessments for which extensions may not be possible or a shorter than requested extension is available. This may be due to group assignments, in-class presentations, weekly/biweekly assessments in which grading is provided immediately after the submission date, assignments scaffolding into other assignments in a shortened period of time, and more. Students facing barriers with meeting deadlines for these kinds of assessments must work with their instructor prior to the due date to discuss an appropriate alternative which are up to the instructors’ discretion.
 * Appropriate alternatives may include:
 * Accepting an assessment that has not been fully completed (i.e., 75% completion).
 * Allowing pass/fail on a deliverable.  Re-weighting of grade.
 * Allowing students the maximum extension possible when 7 calendar days are not feasible (due to the scaffolding of assignments).
 * Combining grades for two scaffolded assignments into one grade.
 * Other appropriate instructor/student decided options that remove student barriers.
 * Providing alternate ways for a student to demonstrate knowledge.
 * Instructors may consult with QSAS if an appropriate alternative cannot be reached.
This accommodation should be used sparingly by students experiencing disability related barriers. It is **highly recommended** that **students develop a term calendar** at the beginning of the semester that includes all their assignments and exams. This will help students adjust their schedule when this accommodation is used.
To **learn how to design** a term calendars, and other helpful time budgeting and scheduling strategies, please connect with **[Student Academic Success Services (SASS)](https://sass.queensu.ca/resources/online/time-management).**

# [For Students | Financial Services](https://www.queensu.ca/financialservices/students) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/financialservices/students_

Students are expected to pay their tuition fees, residence fees, administrative fees, accrued late fees and all other outstanding fees in full by the corresponding due dates.
Queen’s will make every reasonable attempt to contact a student who has an outstanding account balance to collect the balance owing. If these attempts are unsuccessful, the account will be sent to a collection agency. The provisions of the [Senate Sanction policy](http://www.queensu.ca/registrar/resources/policies/fees) will remain in effect until the balance is paid in full.
**Payment of fees**
While every effort is made to avoid errors in fee assessment, should an error occur, it will be corrected and every effort made to notify affected students. However, lack of notification does not exempt a student from paying the appropriate fee.
Queen’s will make every reasonable attempt to contact the student regarding any outstanding debt BEFORE passing the student account to a collection agency. Therefore, it is in the student’s best interests to keep their contact information current on SOLUS, even after they graduate. If the student doesn’t remember their username or password, they can [contact ITS for help.](https://queensu.service-now.com/esm?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0011167&sys_kb_id=fb1efddf1bbc055438e4da43cc4bcbaa)

**POLICY STATEMENTS**
**Commitment to Student Housing**
The university will ensure that information regarding housing services, supports and resources is readily available to students through easy-to-access websites. The university will provide a suitable range of housing options that are inclusive of the diverse needs of the student population and guided by student enrolment levels. The university will consider the Kingston rental housing context and develop community partnerships where appropriate.
Residence Life & Services within the Housing and Ancillary Services Portfolio provide services and programming for the nearly 5,000 students living on-campus in 18 distinct residence buildings. This unit primarily serves first-year undergraduate students. Information on residences is readily available to students on the [Queen's Residences website](https://www.queensu.ca/residences/).
The Community Housing unit within Housing & Ancillary Services manages “off-campus” university-owned rental properties, including those in the University District, as well as John Orr Tower on west campus and the An Clachan complex on Van Order Drive. Housing in the University district is primarily for upper year undergraduate students, with John Orr Tower and An Clachan serving graduate student populations, including those with dependents. Information on off-campus housing is readily available to students on the [Community Housing website](https://www.queensu.ca/community-housing/).
**Institutional Infrastructure including off-campus housing resources**
The Community Housing unit also hosts the Office of the Off-Campus Living Advisor (OCLA) and maintains an accommodation listing service to facilitate access to information regarding local private rental properties available in the Kingston community. The OCLA provides service for domestic, international, exchange, graduate and undergraduate students. The OCLA provides one-on-one advising and delivers housing resource fairs and talks, to assist students with respect to housing searches, general tenant education and leases. The OCLA educates students with respect to rights and responsibilities of both tenants and landlords, shares safety and other local resource information (eg local bylaws, garbage collection, transportation), shares resources for short-term housing and makes referrals to available financial supports, provided via the university’s [Financial Aid Services](https://www.queensu.ca/registrar/financial-aid). The OCLA collaborates with City of Kingston staff to educate students regarding topics such as garbage/recycling, bylaw enforcement, safety and good citizenship behaviours. Information on the OCLA is readily available to students on the [OCLA website](https://www.queensu.ca/ocla/).
Both the Residence Life & Services and Community Housing units are accountable for providing support, information and guidance to students with respect to housing options, rights and responsibilities. Each unit maintains comprehensive webpages and resources to inform and guide students with respect to their local housing options and the range of housing services available.

# [Professional Development at Queen’s: How it Works](https://www.queensu.ca/grad-postdoc/professional-development/about) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/grad-postdoc/professional-development/about_

## An Integrated Skills-based Framework for Your Academic, Professional, and Personal Success
Our mission at the SGSPA is to enable graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to develop the capacities needed to lead us collectively into a better future. Learning at Queen’s is inspired by an inclusive and collaborative community that balances wellbeing, academic excellence, and professional growth.
Using an integrated skills-based framework, our programming builds on knowledge and applied skills already learned to explore additional competencies to prepare for future careers, whether in academic or non-academic fields.
Our professional and academic development opportunities provide graduate students and postdoctoral fellows with diverse learning opportunities to cultivate a range of personal, professional, and academic skills to achieve continued success as globally engaged citizens.
The SGSPA, in collaboration with various Queen’s and external partners, offers a suite of skill-building workshops and opportunities. Using a holistic approach our framework consists of four key sectors: “Community” is our uniting theme, with the intersecting pillars of “Academic,” “Wellbeing,” and “Professional.”
To address each sector, we offer a range of activities – modules, workshops or events – for students and postdocs to choose from throughout their time at Queen’s. The diversity of our offerings allows you to select which areas and competencies you wish to strengthen, while also reflecting on what you have learned.
In consultation with our partners, an annual calendar of activities will be provided and tagged according to both the sector, the type of activity and who will be hosting the activity.
## Opportunities for Professional Development
As part of your development, you can access and participate in various professional development programs and events, which are all available on our [searchable calendar](https://www.queensu.ca/grad-postdoc/professional-development/workshops-events "Workshops & Events"). These include:

#### _Add '**Women in Science at Queen's - WiSQ**' calendar to your outlook calendar to see our events!_
Women in Science Queen’s (WiSQ) is supported by the Employee Resource Group funded by a Inclusive Community Fund (ICF) provided by the Human Rights and Equity Office.
Founded by Dr. Patricia Lima, adjunct assistant professor in the Queen’s Cardiopulmonary Unit (QCPU), who was looking to help other women as they explore and build upon their careers at Queen’s while at the same time helping foster equity within science.  Other goals include promoting discussions about gender bias in science; incentivizing the active participation and leadership of women; and establishing a visible, equitable, diverse and inclusive community promoting the development and retention of women across all scientific disciplines.
We became official in 2019 and are now in our second year, ready to bring 10 more monthly seminars, including hosting meetings to discuss issues of equity, career development, and work-life balance.  We also hope to hold more external events with hopes of being able to connect with more women's community grouos.  Please add us on Twitter to find out about our events, or add our group to your outlook calendar.

# [How to Withdraw | Residence](https://www.queensu.ca/residences/residence-services/how-withdraw) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/residences/residence-services/how-withdraw_

## 2024-25 Queen's Withdrawal From Residence Policy 
Your residence Contract is for a period (the “Term”) beginning on your scheduled Move-In Day, and ending on your Move-Out Day. After the commencement of the “Term”, whether or not you have taken occupancy, you cannot cancel this Contract, and you are financially responsible for the full 8-month term room and meal plan fees (or 4-month term fees for fall-only or winter-only exchange students). Exceptions apply for students who withdraw from the University for approved academic or medical reasons. 
## **Medical and/or Academic Withdrawal** 
You may request cancellation of your Contract only if withdrawing from the University for approved academic or medical reasons. If you are withdrawing due to an approved academic or medical reason, we will issue refunds according to the schedule below. There are three things you must do to receive a prorated refund of your room and meal plan fees:  
1. Withdraw from program courses through the faculty or Registrar’s office (course enrolment cancellation is verified by the Residence Admissions office).  
 
2. Complete the Residence withdrawal form in the [Residence and Dining Portal](https://studentweb.housing.queensu.ca/).
 
3. Vacate your room and return keys to the designated front desk for your building.  
 
Your withdrawal date is set as the date that all three steps are completed. If you leave Residence without following all steps required, you will be required to pay your Residence fees in full for the entire Term of your Contract.  
## Fee Refund Schedule
This refund schedule includes your Residence room and Meal Plan fees and is for approved medical and/or academic withdrawals only. Residence Meal Plans for any other reason are non-refundable or transferable. However, the remaining Flex$ portion of your Meal Plan can be refunded for a $50 administration fee, or it can be carried over for use in future academic terms.  
### **Fall term** 
* Prorated to withdrawal date until November 1st. A minimum fee of $525 applies.
 
* November 1 to end of fall term – 0% (but the student will be released from winter term fees)
 
### **Winter term**  
* Prorated to withdrawal date until March 1st  
 
* March 1 to move out – 0%  
 
### Withdrawal from Residence but not Academics
Between Move-In and Move-Out, if you want to withdraw from residence but do not plan to withdraw academically, you may be granted permission to cancel the Contract if the University is able to identify another full-time Queen’s student not currently living in Residence to take over the Contract. The Residence Life and Services Office must approve the replacement before permission to cancel the Contract will be granted.
If you want to withdraw from residence without withdrawing from academics for a situation in which you feel that the residence environment is causing a medical concern, you must set up a meeting with the Manager, Residence Admissions. If you do not follow this process, you will be held liable for any associated room and meal plan charges. These requests will be assessed on a case-by-case basis involving the Manager, Residence Admissions and Director, Residence Life and Services. A refund is not guaranteed.
### Termination of Contract for Disciplinary Reasons 
If the University terminates your Contract as a result of a violation of your Residence Contract and/or University Policies, you remain responsible for payment of the full room and meal plan fees for the 8-month term (4-month term for half term exchange students). If your Contract is terminated for this reason, you will not be eligible to live in Residence or Queen’s Community Housing for the remainder of the current academic year. Housing requests for future academic years may be considered on an individual basis.  
If more information is needed, please visit the Residence Admissions office in Victoria Hall, room D001 or by emailing [reshouse@queensu.ca](mailto:reshouse@queensu.ca) or by calling 613-533-2550.

# [Endaayaan – Tkanónsote Building Education](https://www.queensu.ca/residences/endaayaan-tkanonsote-building-education) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/residences/endaayaan-tkanonsote-building-education_

Our newest 334-bed residence building Endaayaan – Tkanónsote opened in September 2022 on Albert Street. The building sets a high bar for sustainability and cultural inclusion with modern amenities to attract students, and it aligns with the goals and values in the Queen’s University Strategy, For the Future, particularly: “We accept our responsibility to build a diverse, equitable, inclusive and anti-racist community for our people, to Indigenize and decolonize the academy, and in all that we do, to observe the interest of the planet and the life it sustains.”
##### Naming History
Hear the pronunciation:
Endaayaan – Tkanónsote pronounced: (End-ah-yawn – t-gaw-noon-so-day) is Indigenous words for home, reflecting the building’s purpose and function as your home at this unique time in your lives, as you meet new people, and grow and thrive as individuals and new members of the Queen’s community. 
The structure and approach to the name in both, the Anishinaabemowin (Ojibway) and Kanyen’kéha (Mohawk) languages, acknowledges the traditional territory lands, history, and significance for the Indigenous peoples who lived, and continue to live, upon it. It's an inclusive approach to naming residences, and one we hope to build on. [Learn more!](https://www.queensu.ca/gazette/stories/newest-student-residence-honours-local-indigenous-lands-communities-and-histories)
##### LEED Gold 
The building targets Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification. Endaayaan – Tkanónsote is on Albert Street, South of Union Street on a site that was previously occupied by five (5) university-owned houses. The building — which integrated two of the original five houses from the site into its design, maintains the look and feel of the surrounding community. It provides a significant investment into sustainable student housing, while providing inclusive, and accessible spaces.

## Administering Awards
At Queen’s, all awards (scholarships, fellowships, prizes, QGA, etc.) administered by or through the SGSPA are paid through direct deposit to the recipient’s bank account of record (see below). This direct deposit method is only for those internal and external awards, fellowships, scholarships, Queen’s Graduate Award (QGA), etc. administered by the SGSPA.
If you have completed registration, set up a bank account of record, and met the eligibility requirements of your award, your funds will appear in your bank account within 5 to 7 business days after the ‘posted date’ on the Student On-Line University System (SOLUS).
Your department has a separate process to make arrangements for Teaching Assistantship (TA) and Research Assistantship (RA) payments to be deposited in your bank account.
If you pay tuition through the Pre-Authorized Payment Plan, the bank account used for the tuition payment is your bank account of record. If you pay tuition in any other way, you must set up a bank account of record to receive direct deposits of your award payments.
The bank account of record must be held at a valid Canadian bank. The bank account of record will receive award payments for any award you receive for the duration of your graduate student enrolment.
To confirm your bank account of record or to set up banking information, log in to SOLUS and enter or review your banking information (found at the bottom of the page under “enter/review bank”).
Any award installment payments are shown in SOLUS in your “Student Centre." Scroll down to the “Finances” section, and under “Other Financial” select “Payments” to see your “Payment history," which is a record of awards paid to date or scheduled to be paid.
The “Date Paid” is the date that the direct deposit is "Initiated". Please note that you must add 4 to 5 business days after the “Date Paid” date, or to the date that you have completed registration, set up your bank account of record, and/or met any other eligibility requirements, for these funds to appear in your bank account of record.
Students who transfer from full-time on-campus status to part-time or inactive status are not eligible for most fellowships, scholarships, and awards (including QGA). If funding has already been provided for the term(s) of proposed part-time or inactive status, that funding must be returned to the School of Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs. Changing to part-time or inactive status may impact your repayment requirements to OSAP or any other student loan provider.

2. Research Integrity
## What is research integrity?
A foundational commitment of the University is to strive for research and scholarly practices that exemplify honesty, truthfulness, fairness, respect, responsibility and the courage to adhere to these values, according to the International Center for Academic Integrity. More specifically, a commitment to integrity calls for researchers and scholars to:
* Deal fairly with colleagues and students
* Adhere to relevant ethical principles
* Carry out research in an honest and rigorous search for knowledge
* Interpret findings according to scientific, scholarly and/or creative principles
* Make results of work accessible
* Identify affiliations and contributions accurately
* Retain research records in accordance with relevant protocols
* Honestly comply with funding agency requirements
* Be proactive in rectifying integrity breaches
A corollary to this commitment to integrity is that researchers and scholars must also strive to maintain the overall integrity of the research and scholarly enterprise at the University by reporting suspected instances of research or scholarly misconduct to the Office of the Vice-Principal (Research) to request a referral to an advisor who will provide confidential advice regarding the matter, prior to the individual deciding whether to submit a formal written complaint.
## Important Resources on Integrity in Research

# [3 Steps to Smart Gift Giving](https://www.queensu.ca/grad-postdoc/graduate-studies/gradifying-blog/3-steps-smart-gift-giving) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/grad-postdoc/graduate-studies/gradifying-blog/3-steps-smart-gift-giving_

As we approach the holiday season, I want to delve into the art of gift-giving as a graduate student. Contrary to popular belief, being a fantastic gift giver doesn't necessarily mean breaking the bank. It's more about the effort you put into understanding the other person's needs and desires. So, while it may not cost much money, being a fantastic gift giver does take effort!
Before thinking about the actual gifts, it's crucial to have a realistic budget that aligns with your means. Equally important is knowing the person you're gifting. Once these two pillars are in place, you're ready to follow the next steps and apply them to every gift-giving situation.
**Step 1: The Useful Gift**
That's where you usually spend the most money, but you can handmake or thrift gifts, too! The useful gift is about **improving the other person's life**, whether through a desire or a necessity. Depending on who they are and their lifestyle, this could mean vastly different things. Observe their habits, hobbies and interests to get clues. Create a list on your phone to note these down whenever you notice something. Here are some of my suggestions:
* The skincare lover: go to [Maneko Living](https://www.instagram.com/maneko_living/?hl=en) and buy a new sunscreen for them to try. You can find some good options around $12 + tax.
* The practical one: restock their toiletries (just trust me). Or sock drawer. The [Adidas outlet](https://www.instagram.com/adidaskingston/) has some great, affordable options. Register for the Adidas Club and show your student ID for a discount.
* The homebody: get them the [coziest and cutest sleepers](https://blnts.com/collections/bn_womens-sleepwear_slippers-1?srsltid=AfmBOorLD_lzf4uMZMkT7Sn7ODzifxnwxk2kvT5CCZ6Ozkzkl_B1bNH1) from Bluenotes, starting from $8 + tax. If you go in person to one of their stores, you get a coupon to participate in a giveaway.
* The crafter: go to dollar and thrift stores, gather supplies, and arrange them into a nice basket.
* The minimalist: get them the [most perfect cotton t-shirt](https://www.uniqlo.com/ca/en/products/E465185-000?colorCode=COL09&sizeCode=SMA002) from Uniqlo.
* The meal prepper: finding a good lunch bag is hard. Staples has some good models, but this [one is my favourite—it's spacious and leakproof](https://www.staples.ca/products/503253-en-swiss-gear-insulated-2-compartment-lunch-bag-black).  
* The tea aficionado: visit [Cha Cha Tea](https://www.chachatea.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoozmxIzKw3y2uWkw52yG3lnqyn-uDqkhTa-B14OmoaABTOKLxRF) and ask Kaoru-san for a recommendation. Or get the Eternally Nuts blend - the best tea ever. If they already have a favourite, you can choose a tea accessory like an infuser or a cute cup.
**Step 2: The Fun Gift**
The fun gift is all about **bringing joy to the person you're gifting.** It's the most straightforward category, and you can even combine it with the other gift categories. The key is to ensure the fun component is there. I personally like to include their favourite candy in the packaging, just to add an extra element of fun.
**Step 3: The Intimate Gift**
The purpose of the intimate gift is to **show the other person you are connected**. Different people react and show love (independently if it's romantic, friendship, etc.) differently. I usually go for a self-made card with heartfelt words about the person, what I like about them and what I wish for the upcoming year. You can sing or play them a song, recite poetry, make a customized calendar or photo collage, give them coupons for activities with you, send them their favourite flowers, ask them to dance – endless possibilities!
However you decide to distribute the "weights" of each category, don't forget the packaging! I said three steps, but this is essential to the experience component. The dollar store, YouTube and Pinterest tutorials are your best friends here. Also, while you're giving them their gift(s), be sure to explain the purpose behind each aspect. You can tell a little story about what you noticed about them and why you chose that gift. Be creative and resourceful! They will definitely feel seen and appreciated, making the gift even more special.

## Exam Communications
The Exams Office is committed to keeping students informed about important dates, processes, and deadlines impacting examinations.
In order to help you get the information you need to fully prepare for your exams, we invite you to review the messages that have been e-mailed to students, as well as their contents:
**The Fall 2024 Exam Schedule is now available in the SOLUS Student Centre.** 
  **Please read all the following information carefully.**
  **Where do I find the schedule?**
* Students can view their exam schedule in the SOLUS Student Centre by selecting the “Exam Schedule” tile. It contains both the times and on-campus locations of each exam session. These instructions are also available online here. 
* If you have an exam that is NOT listed in SOLUS, please contact your instructor for clarification, as this would mean that the exam is not being administered by the Exams Office.
**Before you write…** 
Before you arrive to write your exam, please be aware of the following rules:
* If you are sick on the day of your examination: It is recommended that students who are ill on the day of an examination not write the exam. Such students should seek health services, if needed, and follow up with their home Faculty/School.
* Students who experience an unexpected illness during an examination must notify a proctor prior to leaving so the student’s home Faculty/School can be informed of the event with an incident report. When students leave an examination without notifying a proctor of an unexpected illness, it will be assumed that they completed the exam. 
* All exam venues are scent-free. Please refrain from wearing scented products, including perfume or cologne, to your exam.
* Once arriving at the exam hall, please review the blackboard/whiteboard to determine which room(s) your exam is in. Please congregate near, but DO NOT ENTER that room. If all rooms are hosting the same exam, you may congregate in the general area. The proctors will direct students into the room at the appropriate time.
* Please ensure you bring only items required for your exam as all other personal belongings, including all bags, must be left in the hallway. Queen’s University assumes no responsibility for lost or stolen items.
* Students may wear their coats into the exam venue, and they may be placed on the back of the chair. If for any reason the coat impedes traffic in the aisle behind the chair, students will be required to adjust the placement of the coat to ensure safety standards are met. Proctors may advise students of impediments, and students are to follow the direction of the proctors regarding coat placement.
* Please ensure you have visited the restroom and have all your required items before entering the exam hall. Once admitted to the exam hall prior to the exam beginning, students will not be allowed to exit the hall until after the first half hour of the exam (e.g., 9:30 / 2:30 / 7:30).
* You will need your Student Photo ID Card to gain admittance to the exam hall. A $50.00 fine will be applied to those who do not bring their card. For a replacement card, please complete the [Student Card Replacement Form](https://queensu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3xASqFpfAa7mctM), you will receive an email when your card is ready for pickup. Pickup happens Monday through Friday in Gordon Hall, Room 125 from 9:30 am until 4:00 pm. Double-check that you have your card for an evening or weekend exam since the office is closed during those hours.
* Students enrolled in an online course writing in an off-campus location may use an alternate form of government-issued ID.
* Use of communication and electronic devices with memory and/or audio capabilities and/or web access is prohibited during an examination. All electronic devices must be turned off and placed underneath the candidate's seat. This includes your cell phone and your smartwatch.
* Ensure you bring only the authorized aids for your exam. 
* **CALCULATORS:** The approved exam calculator is the Casio 991, or with an approved blue sticker for School of Business (COMM) exams only. If you require a blue sticker for your calculator for a COMM exam, you should visit the Commerce Office to obtain one.
* If you do not have the correct calculator with you in the exam, you may be required to write the exam without a calculator. You will not be permitted to leave the exam hall to get a different calculator, nor should you expect spares to be present in the exam venue.
 **I am in a Distance Studies course and am writing off-campus. What do I need to know?**
* The rooms listed are only for on-campus exams.
* The date and time listed for on-campus exams are the same for off-campus exams.
* If you are in an online course and have selected to complete your exam online remotely through ProctorU/Examity, you can confirm this under Class Schedule.
* Arts & Science Online (ASO) will inform you of details related to scheduling your online exam through ProctorU/Examity at a later date. 
* If you have questions about your online exam, please contact ASO at [aso.exams@queensu.ca](mailto:aso.exams@queensu.ca). 
**Conflicts** 
The Exams Office accepts applications for resolution of the following conflicts ONLY: 
* Two exams at the same time
* Three consecutive exams (e.g., one 9 am, one 2 pm, and one 7 pm exam slot) 
**Religious Observance:**
* Fall 2024 Final exams run from December 7 to 21 inclusive. As always, students requiring accommodation for religious observance will be accommodated, provided they make their request in writing prior to the **November 15** deadline. Students should read the religious accommodation FAQ found at https://www.queensu.ca/registrar/academic-info/exams/students. 
* **PLEASE NOTE:** the Ontario Human Rights Code does not obligate the university to provide travel time to observe any religious holiday in a preferred location. The only requirement is to provide the time off for the observance itself. Students may direct their questions about religious accommodation to the University Chaplain: [chaplain@queensu.ca](mailto:chaplain@queensu.ca)
 **Exchange Students (whose first language is not English)**
* All exchange students **whose first language is not English** can apply to the Exams Office for an extra ½ hour of time to write final and mid-year exams. Students are also allowed to bring in one (1) **paper** language translation dictionary. Electronic dictionaries are NOT permitted.
* Eligible students will be contacted after the exam schedule has been posted with instructions on how to apply. If you have not received this communication by the end of October (for December exams) or the end of February (for April exams), contact the Exams Offices ([exams@queensu.ca](mailto:exams@queensu.ca)). Students must complete and submit their request by the following dates:
* November 15 (December exams)
* March 15 (April exams)
* **The deadline dates are firm. No applications will be accepted after the deadline date.** 
**Students registered with Student Wellness Services (SWS)**
* Student Wellness Services include Accessibility, Health, and Counselling Services.
* If you have been approved for accommodations through SWS, you do not need to request accommodations for SOLUS-listed Fall 2024 Final exams, these will be automatically applied through Ventus once the schedule has been imported. 
* **Accommodated exams are scheduled at the same date and time as what is posted on SOLUS unless a student’s accommodation prohibits us from scheduling at that time\*. If an accommodated exam must be moved, it will be moved to the nearest possible exam slot following the originally scheduled exam date and time. You should be able to view your final schedule on Ventus by November 15.** 
\*Exams listed at 9:00 am in SOLUS will start at 8:30 am in the accommodated venues. Similarly, exams scheduled at 2:00 pm in SOLUS will start at 1:45 pm in the accommodated venues. This is to allow for a minimum 15-minute gap between students writing in the accommodated venues. 
  All exams begin at 08:30 am and end by 10 pm. Additional time is always allotted as follows:
* at the end of an 08:30 am exam (e.g. 08:30-1:00 pm)
* either the beginning or end of a 1:45 pm exam (e.g.-5:30 pm or 1:45-6:15 pm)
* at the beginning of the exam for a 7 pm exam (e.g. 5:30-10 pm)
* If you have not seen your accommodated exam arrangements on Ventus or you believe there to be an error, please contact the Exams Office at [exams@queensu.ca](mailto:exams@queensu.ca) **at least three days in advance of your exam.** 
* **If you do not require an accommodated assessment for any reason, including dropped courses, illness, etc., you MUST cancel the accommodated assessment on Ventus in advance of the exam, or you will be charged $45 per exam missed.**
* If you make alternate arrangements with your instructor or the department, you must cancel your accommodated exam arrangements on Ventus. 
* If you have an exam that is NOT listed in SOLUS, please contact your instructor for accommodation as this would mean that the exam is not being administered by the Exams Office.

## Policies & Appeals
## Fee Policies
The Board of Trustees reserves the right to make changes, without notice, in the scale of fees. If fee changes are approved after publication deadlines, every effort will be made to notify students affected. However, lack of notification does not exempt a student from paying the appropriate fee. Normally, fee increases, if applicable, become effective September 1 each year. Acceptance of fee payment does not necessarily imply acceptance of registration.
While every effort is made to avoid errors in fee assessment, should an error occur, it will be corrected and every effort is made to attempt to notify affected students. However, lack of notification does not exempt a student from paying the appropriate fee.
* [Ancillary fees](https://www.queensu.ca/registrar/tuition-fees/ancillary "Ancillary Fees") for the next academic year are approved by the Board of Trustees at their May meeting. Therefore, students registered full or part-time, who start their program in May, may be assessed ancillary fees retroactively
The Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Development (MAESD) regulates the fees that universities are permitted to charge students. These guidelines are a reference for Queen’s faculty and staff to evaluate whether specific course related fees are allowable under the MAESD protocol.
[Guidelines to Queen’s Compulsory Course Related Fees](https://www.queensu.ca/registrar/sites/uregwww/files/uploaded_files/pdfs/Policy/Financial%20Aid%20and%20Fee%20Policies%20and%20Appeals/Guidelines_Course_Related_Fees.pdf) (PDF, 391.7 KB)
The university accepts no responsibility for uninsured medical expenses incurred by students or their dependents. International students who do not have health or hospital insurance valid in Ontario during OHIP's 3-month waiting period, will be enrolled  for the University Health Insurance Plan (UHIP). For more information, visit [https://quic.queensu.ca/health-insurance/enrolment](https://quic.queensu.ca/health-insurance/enrolment%C2%A0) 
* International students registered at Queen's University and residing in Ontario must enrol themselves, and their dependents in Ontario, in mandatory basic health insurance through the University Health Insurance Plan (UHIP)
* Canadian students from other provinces must inform their local Ministry of Health that they will be studying in Ontario. Canadian students from outside Canada are eligible to apply for free provincial basic health insurance (Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP)) while studying in Ontario.
The cost of assessment materials bundled with electronic learning materials is exempt from the requirements for approval according to an ancillary fee protocol. The university notes that such costs to students in need are offset by funding from the [Queen’s General Bursary.](https://www.queensu.ca/registrar/financial-aid/application-required/current-students/general-bursary "General Bursary") Nevertheless, if students find it an exceptional hardship to afford the cost of assessment materials bundled with electronic learning materials required for a course and to be used to create a significant portion of the final grade, they may appeal for an increase in their General Bursary assessment.
Once a payment has been returned from the bank for any reason, a $40 service charge is applied. If the return was caused by a bank error, on request, the Office of the University Registrar will issue a receipt for the service charge in the event you wish to seek reimbursement from your bank.
Semi-annually, in June and November, overdue accounts from the preceding summer, fall, and winter terms may be placed in the hands of a collection agency. For more information, visit the [Financial Services website.](https://www.queensu.ca/financialservices/students)
A service charge, (prime + 3%), will be assessed on the 15th day of each month. Service charges are calculated on the overdue amount. Starting September 2015, no service charges will be levied in September, January, and May.
[Current and Past Service Charge Rates](https://www.queensu.ca/registrar/sites/uregwww/files/uploaded_files/20241010_service_charges_rate.pdf) (PDF, 40 KB)
## Appeal Processes
If your payment is made less than five (5) business days before the fee deadline, it is likely that your payment will not be posted to SOLUS by the due date.
If you have been charged a late fee, you may appeal the late fee if your payment was made prior to the due date but the amount was not posted to your account until after that date.
Please include a copy of your proof of payment with your appeal and send it to [fees@queensu.ca](mailto:fees@queensu.ca) or fax: 613.533.2068.
Senate Policy states that official transcripts may not be released until the outstanding account is settled in full or until an acceptable arrangement for settling the account is made.
This policy will be waived in the following circumstances and at the written request of the student.
* **BEd Students**: One transcript may be sent to the Ontario College of Teachers
* **Law Students**: One transcript may be released to a second year law student for the purpose of applying for an articling position that they would take up after they finish their law degree. One transcript may be released to the Law Society for the purpose of being called to the Bar
If you require a transcript, but cannot pay the outstanding debt in full, please submit an appeal for a transcript, including your proposed payment arrangement by submitting the following form: [Outstanding Debt- Transcript Appeal](https://queensu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_555hZV37t4q3hKS).
If your appeal is approved, only one transcript will be released to the intended recipient. It will not be released directly to the student.
Students are expected to familiarize themselves with the Queen’s University Fees Policy, the Payment Due Dates, Refund Policy, and Financial Drop Deadlines.
In rare situations, a student may wish to submit an appeal for a Tuition Fee Amendment on the grounds of serious extenuating circumstances (e.g., sudden injury or sudden onset of illness; death of an immediate family member; or other serious life crisis) that prevent the student from completing their courses. 
Such extenuating circumstances may warrant a reversal/refund, in part or in full of their assessed tuition fees after the last date for refund/reversal within the published withdrawal schedule.
Students must submit a letter outlining the nature of the appeal along with supporting documentation from a healthcare professional (e.g., physician, psychologist, counsellor, etc.), or in cases of death, a copy of the death certificate or obituary notice is required.  
Financial appeals may take up to 60 days to finalize.
NOTE:  A successful academic petition does not guarantee a successful financial appeal.

Please complete the [Appeal for Tuition Fee Amendment](https://queensu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eeZgEJO5A13GBXE) form to initiate your request.
[Senate Policy](https://www.queensu.ca/registrar/node/87#student-debtors) states that any student with an overdue debt with the university will not be permitted to register until the outstanding account is settled in full or until an acceptable arrangement for settling the account is made.
If you wish to register, but cannot pay the outstanding debt in full, please **submit an appeal** to register with debt. Your appeal must include:
* A description of the extenuating circumstances that led to the outstanding balance
* A budget that outlines ALL of your expenses and sources of income
* A repayment plan
To appeal to register with debt, complete the [ATRWD form](https://queensu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5AAXGCCH4ocFcxg). For any questions or concerns, please email [reg.appeals@queensu.ca](mailto:reg.appeals@queensu.ca).
* If OSAP is one of your sources of income, be sure to apply for OSAP **before** you submit your appeal. The appeals committee will provide a decision only after OSAP has provided an assessment
* If you are appealing for a Tuition Fee Amendment, the appeals committee will consider your appeal to register with debt **after** you provide the decision for the Tuition Fee Amendment
Before appealing to the University Registrar’s Tuition and Fee Appeals Committee, students must exhaust their opportunities to appeal to the unit that assessed the fees in question. The University Registrar’s Tuition and Fee Appeals committee is called on to make decisions regarding second-level appeals of tuition, student fees, and all other administrative fees charged by the university. The committee focuses on cases that fall outside of current precedents. Therefore, **the first-level of an appeal must initially be reviewed, and a decision made, by the office that assessed the fee.**
* If, for example, a student wishes to appeal their tuition or student fees, the student must first complete an Appeal of Tuition Fee Amendment form and submit it to the Office of the University Registrar
* If the appeal is regarding a charge for Student Wellness Centre services, then the initial appeal must first be heard by that office, etc.
An appeal to the University Registrar’s Tuition and Fee Appeals committee will only be considered after the initial appeal has been denied. The Committee does not hear appeals denied on the basis of a standing precedent by the office assessing the fee. The committee will only hear appeals based on an appellant providing new information or showing that an error was made by a department that resulted in fees being posted inappropriately. Normally, **only currently registered students may appeal tuition and fees.**
An appeal to the University Registrar’s Tuition and Fee Appeals Committee must be commenced within **12 weeks of the negative decision of the office assessing the fee**. Appeals to the University Registrar’s Tuition and Fee Appeals committee must be submitted in writing (with all appropriate documentation) to [toni.easter@queensu.ca](mailto:toni.easter@queensu.ca) or faxed to the attention of Ms. Easter at (613) 533-6409.
* Appellants will not normally be permitted to make in-person presentations to the committee
* The Chair of the committee will communicate the decision to the appellant within ten (10) business days of the meeting where the decision was made
* The decisions of the committee are final

# [Advancing mining in a high-tech world](https://www.queensu.ca/partnershipsandinnovation/news/advancing-mining-high-tech-world) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/partnershipsandinnovation/news/advancing-mining-high-tech-world_

As [originally published in The Queen's Gazette](https://www.queensu.ca/gazette/stories/advancing-mining-high-tech-world), September 30, 2024 
By Catarina Chagas, Research Outreach and Events Specialist
**_Researcher Charlotte Gibson discusses the current challenges in finding and processing the critical minerals present in batteries, electric vehicles, and other high demand products._**
Dr. Charlotte Gibson (Mining Engineering), head of the Critical Minerals Processing Lab
When you think of mining, does your mind go to pickaxes and dangerous underground environments? Think again. Autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence, and machine learning are being more and more integrated into today’s mining landscape to address safety, sustainability, and efficiency issues. Applications of mined metal and mineral products also look different these days: they are used to create some essential components of modern life – from smartphones to electric cars – and important pieces of infrastructure like electrical grids.
In a world increasingly dependent on these technologies, it is crucial for countries to secure the domestic supply of elements that allow them to produce and commercialize these items. Copper, lithium, cobalt, nickel, rare earth elements, and graphite are examples of the critical minerals that governments, including Canada, are paying special attention to.
The _Gazette_ spoke to [Charlotte Gibson](https://smithengineering.queensu.ca/directory/faculty/charlotte-gibson) (Mining Engineering), head of the [Critical Minerals Processing Lab](https://criticalmineralsprocessinglab.com/), to learn more about how Queen’s is at the forefront of research and capacity building when it comes to mining and critical minerals.
**What is the definition of critical minerals?**
When today’s governments talk about “critical minerals” they are referring to metals for which we have identified some sort of limited supply and/or supply risk, and we have no viable substitute. For example, it could be because a particular element’s supply is isolated to a single geographic region, meaning that, if there was any sort of natural disaster or change in geopolitical conditions in that region, the supply of that material would no longer be available.
**How does technology support the development of new mining processes?**
Many technological advancements that we see today in mainstream society have roots in the mining industry. A good example is autonomous vehicles, which are incredibly useful in mining. One the one hand, autonomous vehicles can work non-stop, allowing mines to be running and operating 24-hours a day. On the other hand, there is an important safety component: we have vehicles running underground without subjecting people to this environment. Automation is a huge topic in the field and there are a few mines around the world that are now operating with autonomous haul truck fleets.
AI and machine learning are also finding their way into the mining industry, as they are into all parts of our day-to-day lives. One important example is mineral processing. Mining industries have been collecting process data online, in real time, for decades. There is this huge wealth of data associated with processing minerals and rocks that is now being leveraged through machine learning models to improve process efficiency. These models take information about the rocks that are mined and help us dial in process conditions to increase the recovery of valuable minerals from the rock and reduce waste.
**What challenges is your research currently trying to solve?**
My research focuses on the processing stage. After the actual mining part, when the rocks come to surface and have been drilled and blasted and dug up, we need to concentrate the minerals that contain valuable metals from the waste minerals. Hundreds of years ago, this process was mainly done by labour intensive methods like hand sorting and gold panning, but today our techniques are far more advanced and productive. One of the ways we now separate minerals is through a process called flotation.
In this process, we make the minerals that we want to recover repel water and be attracted to air, so that, when we mix the rock slurry with air, the valuable minerals stick to the surface of air bubbles and float to the top of the tank.
My team mainly investigates flotation and we are currently focusing on lithium mineral flotation. As you may know, lithium is in high demand for energy transition as it is an important component in electric vehicle batteries. We have a lot of lithium deposits in Canada, but we only have one that is currently producing lithium, and one of the main reasons for this are the challenges we have in the flotation process.
**What are some of the other projects that the Critical Minerals Processing Lab is working on?**
We have been working with industry partners to use AI in copper-nickel flotation: we place several different sensors in flotation tanks and use the data to predict process performance and behavior. The lab is also working to develop a process to separate graphite from waste minerals using no water, through air separation.
**What does the future of critical minerals mining in Canada look like?**
There is a growing interest in critical minerals, and we expect thousands of jobs in mining and processing will be created in the coming decade – capacity building is imperative for the Canadian mining industry to stay globally competitive.
Queen’s is particularly well positioned to train this new generation of mining engineers, as we have one of the strongest programs in Canada, including unique facilities like an explosives test site. Our curriculum also has a strong focus on the societal and environmental impact side of the mining industry and we built a virtual reality mineral processing plant that has been integrated into several of our undergraduate courses. The use of virtual reality will also improve our capacity for training outside the university, and we are already partnering with industry to provide staff training.
**How do you see industry and academia collaborating to advance mining in Canada?**
In recent years, and in light of all of the excitement around critical minerals, we saw a huge increase in engagement and support for mining research, which is a big change from a decade or two ago. 
Canada doesn’t have a long operating history in exploring some of these critical minerals, like lithium, so we still have a lot of unanswered questions that mining companies just aren't set up to address, and that’s where research comes in. Collaborations between industry and academia can lead to more productivity, more sustainable practices, and to raise the next generation of talent that will work in this field.

## Headings
Using Headings makes it easier for various adaptive technologies to navigate a document. Many people do not create Headings correctly, either making font sizes bigger or in bold rather than using the formats already provided by onQ. Heading levels should have a meaningful hierarchy and it is recommended to reserve H1 for the page title, H2 for major headings and H3 for major sub headings.
onQ has pre-formatted heading and subheading styles you can use to organize content:
1. Place your cursor anywhere in the paragraph in which you would like the new heading style to be applied.
2. Select the dropdown menu on the **Format** button.
3. Select the heading style you want to apply. Your text will be changed to the selected heading style.
  [Designing for the Web: The Web Standards and Accessibility Development Guide](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/across-campus/web-standards-and-accessibility-development-guide/designing-web "Designing for the web")
## Lists
Formatting lists, headings, and links help screen reader users understand the content in context. To create a list in the onQ html editor, select the content you want to make into a list. Then on the toolbar, click either the **Unordered List** icon of the order doesn’t matter, or the **Ordered List** icon if the order does matter (unordered list will be bullet points, ordered list will create numbered items).
## Images and Graphics (including Graphs, Maps & Shapes)
### Alternative Text
Alternative text must give an accurate description of what the item is, so that if a screen reader or refreshable braille display is used, the “Alt tag” will convey the text alternative of the image.
To insert an image into a new onQ content file, place the cursor where you want to insert the image, and click on the **Insert Image** icon  from the toolbar. The “Add a File” window will open you can drag-and-drop a file in the upload window or click upload and navigate to where the image is and click on **Add**. The “Provide Alternate Text” window will open. Type in descriptive text for the image. It is important to write a description that conveys the reason you are including the image – see Below “How to Create Good Alternate Text”. If the image is only for decorative purposes, just click on **This image is decorative** check box and **OK**.
### How to Create Good Alternate Text
* Consider the content and function of your image.
* If it provides content to your document, make sure that the information the image provides is described in the alt text.
* If your image only provides a function (for example, providing a portrait of a historical figure described in the text) you need only describe the image. In the case that the image is of a historical figure, write his/her name as the alt text.
* Try not to use “Image of...” or “Graphic of...” as alt text. That is usually evident to the person reading the alt text.
* Do not repeat the information which is contained in the document itself into the alt text. If it's already in the document, that should be enough.
* Images used for a bullet or spacer should have an empty Alt tag i.e. alt=””
  [ALT Text: The Web Standards and Accessibility Development Guide](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/across-campus/web-standards-and-accessibility-development-guide/development/alt-text "ALT Text")
## Hyperlinks
To link your document to a website or another document, you may use hyperlinks. Below are some tips that web pages at Queen's University should follow:
* **Ensure that the hyperlink has context and describes where it leads**. It should not just read “click here”, and should make it clear what the destination of the link is (example, the web link [www.queensu.ca](http://www.queensu.ca/) should be written as "[Queen's University](http://www.queensu.ca/)").
* **Avoid language that requires spatial or visual references.** One of the greatest powers of the Internet is the ability to cross link related documents, allowing the reader to explore and learn in a non-linear fashion. Content authors must remember, however, that not all users will be experiencing their web pages the same way that the author may be. Instructing readers to click on a 'link on the right,' for example, does not take into consideration the fact that visually impaired users do not see left or right. The same holds true for references to colours or shapes (i.e. click on the 'round' button, or the 'green' text).
* **When linking to a file, indicate the format and document size** for example: Accessible Documents (PDF 75KB).
* **It is best practice that Hyperlinks should open in the same browser window_._** _In onQ you may have the link open in a new window to keep the course open for your students so they can navigate back to the course, but user should be notified when a link open in a new window (e.g. Queen's homepage (opens in a new window)._ Programming a link to open in a new browser window can cause difficulties with novice users for a variety of reasons (i.e. the new window does not retain the current window's browser history and disables the 'back' button function, or the launching of multiple pop-up windows may be blocked by a third-party application), and can disorient people who are using screen-reading or screen-magnification software.
To insert a link in a content file, click on the **Insert Quicklink** icon.
You can choose to link to another area in your course, file, link to an outside webpage etc. To link to an outside webpage, select **URL** in the **Insert Quicklink** window. Type (or paste) the web address into the **URL** field. Enter text that describes the link’s destination in the **Title** field. You will have three options to designate where the link will open.

## Tables
In websites, tables should be used to hold data and **NOT used for design layout**.
Screen readers read tables from left to right, top to bottom, one cell at a time. Merged, nested, and split cells change the reading order of tables. Make sure you construct your table in a way that accommodates good reading order. To create tables with column headers in onQ, create your table using the **Table** icon.
If you are using tables to present data, your table should have appropriate column or row headers. Designating headers in a table is essential to screen reader users understanding how the information is laid out. Highlight the row that you would like to designate as your column header and select the dropdown menu of the **Table** icon. Select **Cell Properties**, and in the **Cell Type** dropdown, you can designate your row or column as the Header.
  [Designing for the Web: The Web Standards and Accessibility Development Guide](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/across-campus/web-standards-and-accessibility-development-guide/designing-web "Designing for the web")
## Colour Contrast
You must provide high colour contrast to the text in your document. A good example of high colour contrast is black and white; while an example of poor colour contrast is light yellow and white.
onQ has a color tool that is very helpful for you to check color contrast. In the html content editing screen, select the text that you want to check and click the drop down menu next to the **Color** icon in the toolbar. When you select a color, the tool will automatically tell you if your selection meets WCAG AA standards with a green checkmark.
  [Colour: The Web Standards and Accessibility Development Guide](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/across-campus/web-standards-and-accessibility-development-guide/designing-web/colour "Colour")
## Accessibility Checker in onQ
The Accessibility Checker is used to review content within the HTML Editor to ensure that the HTML page conforms to the WCAG 2.0 accessibility standards. The Accessibility Checker will indicate if no issues are detected, or if issues are detected the checker will offer suggestions to fix the identified accessibility issue(s). The Accessibility Checker is located on the HTML Editor bar which can be accessed anywhere the HTML Editor is available, including News, Content, Quizzes, Dropboxes, Discussions, and Calendar.
If **issues are detected** a message will appear that indicates how the content does not meet guidelines and suggests a way to fix the issue.
* Select **Repair** to save the suggested fix, or **Ignore** to disregard the suggested fix.
* Use the **Previous** and **Next** buttons to move forward and backward between all detected issues and suggested fixes.
If **no issues are detected** a message will appear that indicates the content conforms to accessibility rules.

The information in this section will help you interpret your Academic Progress Report (APR), available through SOLUS. The Academic Progress Report is designed to give you advice on what courses you will need to take to complete your degree, as well as warn you if you have broken any of the various rules that govern which courses may be used in a particular degree program. While the APR is a useful guide, the ultimate authority on all academic requirements in the Faculty of Arts and Science is the [Academic Calendar](https://www.queensu.ca/academic-calendar/arts-science/); if there is a discrepancy, the online Calendar requirements take precedence. An APR may be run through SOLUS, and it is highly recommended that all upper-year students run a report at least once a year, before the summer class selection period. You should also run a report before applying to graduate. The APR has been designed to closely parallel the layout of the Plan requirements section of the [Academic Calendar](https://www.queensu.ca/academic-calendar/arts-science/), so it may be useful to review these requirements before you run your APR.

## Introduction
Queen’s is committed to building an inclusive community with accessible spaces and services, and has implemented an [Accessibility Framework](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/across-campus/queens-accessibility-initiatives/accessibility-framework) to address accessibility compliance on campus. Making our websites accessible is a key part of ensuring everyone has access to university services and information.
The [Accessibility Hub](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/) and [IT Services](https://www.queensu.ca/its/) have partnered to provide a [**Web-Accessibility Compliance Auditing service**](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/tutorials/website-accessibility/web-accessibility-compliance-auditing-queens-websites "Web-Accessibility Compliance Auditing service") to help you identify ways to improve the accessibility of your website and ensure that it is compliant with the [provincial accessibility requirements](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/across-campus/aoda/integrated-accessibility-standards-regulation-iasr/information-and) outlined in Section 14 of the Accessibility for Ontarians with a Disability Act (AODA).
In an effort to support website owners in ensuring that they are meeting the needs of all users, IT Services negotiated a subscription for [Siteimprove web governance software](https://siteimprove.com/en-ca/). Siteimprove provides flexible reporting for accessibility compliance at Levels A, AA and AAA of WCAG 2.0. It can also be used for general quality assurance, by identifying broken links and misspellings.
Individuals who manage a publicly accessible website at Queen’s will be given unlimited access to the software to perform their own audits and review reports and recommendations. The service is offered free of charge, for the duration of the current subscription.
## Eligibility
Siteimprove user accounts are available to any individual managing one or more publicly-accessible websites associated with Queen’s University.

Additional help and information related to [website accessibility](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/tutorials/website-accessibility) can be found on the Accessibility Hub, including links to resources and [tutorials](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/tutorials). For general questions about accessibility and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0), you can also [connect with the Accessibility Hub](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/connect).
Queen’s University has developed an official resource for creating accessible websites: [The Web Standards and Accessibility Development Guide](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/across-campus/web-standards-and-accessibility-development-guide), which can be used in conjunction with the Queen’s University [Style Guide,](https://www.queensu.ca/styleguide) designed to provide quick reference to important information about the university’s writing guidelines and writing style. All questions regarding the Queen’s University Style Guide should also be directed to [University Communications](https://www.queensu.ca/universityrelations/communications/).

 _https://www.queensu.ca/artsci/undergraduate/experiential-learning/study-abroad_

In order to find the school or study abroad program that is the right fit, students must take the time to investigate and research a variety of options. Students must determine what courses are available, how the courses will fit with their degree at Queen's or their home institution, and whether the location will work for you. This process, much like selecting your exchange partner institution, requires time, careful analysis, and discussion with parents, department heads and academic advisors if necessary.

* [The **Art History** Venice Summer School](https://www.queensu.ca/art/art-history/venice-summer-school "Art History for the Summer in Venice through Queen's University")
* [**Classics** archaeological digs in Italy and North Macedonia](https://www.queensu.ca/classics/archaeology/faculty-directed-field-work)
Students interested in pursuing studies abroad are strongly advised to become familiar during their first year with the range of options open to them, in order to determine which options best meet their needs. The International Programs Office runs a series of information sessions in the fall term, designed to outline study-abroad options and to provide additional information on specific programs.
### Independent Study Abroad
Students may take part in study abroad programs administered by other universities, such as:
* the Canadian Field Studies in Africa program managed by McGill University,
* the Trent-in-Ecuador or Trent-in-Ghana programs managed by Trent University, or
* the Dalhousie Cuba Semester program managed by Dalhousie University.
Students may even spend a term at sea accumulating transfer credits with the Semester-at-Sea program sponsored by the University of Virginia or participate in a language immersion program.
A period of study abroad can last as little as a few weeks and as long as a year, depending on the type of course and/or program and university in which the student intends to study. 
To participate in these study abroad programs, students must apply for admission to the host university and pay tuition fees directly to that institution. 
Also, students must apply for an [International Letter of Permission (ILOP)](https://www.queensu.ca/ipo/outgoing-students/independent-study-abroad/eligibility-and-application)  to receive transfer credit(s) for the courses taken and to retain their Queen's academic status.
[See a list of popular study abroad programs at Queen's University](https://www.queensu.ca/ipo/outgoing-exchange/programs "Study Abroad programs at Queen's University")
### International Letter of Permission and Transfer of Credits
Arts and Science students who wish to participate in a study-abroad experience at another educational institution where Queen’s does not have a formal exchange agreement must apply for an International Letter of Permission through the International Programs Office for the specific courses to be taken. The International Letter of Permission serves as a guarantee that courses taken abroad will be accepted for credit towards a Queen’s degree, and must therefore be obtained prior to making any commitments to a university abroad. Applications can be obtained from the International Programs Office or downloaded from the website. Students should note that course credit will be transferred to Queen’s, but a TR designation will appear on the Queen’s transcript, not the grade achieved at the host institution.

3.10. The University will provide respondents to a complaint with information about sources of support.
### 4\. Awareness, Education and Training
4.1. The Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Service ("SVPRS") and its Coordinator (the “SVPRC”) will work with campus partners to develop and implement an annual education strategy to: 
  (i) promote a culture of consent; 
  (ii) address issues of sexual violence and sexual misconduct; and 
  (iii) facilitate access to supports for students.
4.2. The University will deliver appropriate information and education related to sexual violence and sexual misconduct to the university community, including students in all years, with a focus on incoming students as part of their orientation. The University will work with campus partners to provide ongoing awareness, education and training throughout the year.

4.5. The University will ensure that awareness, education and training initiatives consider the vulnerability of particular communities to sexual violence and, specifically, the intersection of sexual violence with categories such as race, gender, religion, class and ability.
4.6. The University will offer training on this policy, the services of the SVPRS, and information on responding to disclosures of sexual violence. Such training will be available to all staff, faculty, students, and members of the governing board and senior administration. The University strongly encourages employees to complete training appropriate to their role within the University.
### 5\. Support and Accommodation
5.1. A person making a disclosure or complaint, or a respondent may attend meetings with and receive the assistance of a support person and/or advisor. 
5.2. A support person provides support and/or help with understanding of the policy, procedures and outcomes from a disclosure or complaint. A support person may be an employee from a designated support office, a friend, a relative, or any other person who has no direct involvement with the events in question. Potential witnesses may not act as support persons.
5.3 An advisor provides more formal support, for example, as legal counsel or a union representative.
5.4 Support persons and advisors are not to answer investigation questions for a party or interfere. Investigators and decision makers may exclude support persons and advisors who are disruptive or interfering, subject to any right of representation under a collective agreement.
5.5. With written consent, a support person or advisor may also act as the primary point of contact between the University and the supported individual. The University may then communicate with the designated contact person alone.
5.6. The designated support office for students who have made, or would like to make, a disclosure or complaint is the SVPRS. The designated support office for student respondents may be accessed through the Office of the University Ombudsperson (“OUO”). A designated support office does not provide advocacy, or representation for students involved in a complaint process. Other support resources are also available and listed on the SVPRS website.
5.7. A designated support office may: 
  (i) make referrals to both on and off campus resources; 
  (ii) discuss and facilitate appropriate accommodations and supports; 
  (iii) provide information about submitting or responding to a complaint; and 
  (iv) consult on a confidential basis with other internal personnel or resources for safety and support purposes.
5.8. Students requiring [academic considerations](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/senate/academic-consideration-students-extenuating-circumstances-policy) (such as extensions on assignments or deferrals of exams), the dropping of classes, or longer-term academic accommodations may obtain assistance from a designated support office or others. Other sources of support include Student Wellness Services, the CARE Support Services, and the Human Rights and Equity Office.
### 6\. Confidentiality
6.1. The University will treat disclosures and complaints as confidential and comply with applicable privacy legislation.
6.2. There are, however, limits to confidentiality. The University will disclose information to respondents and witnesses as needed to implement immediate or interim measures and to fairly investigate and resolve complaints. The University may also share information about sexual violence (including with its Assessment and Care Team) when there are reasonable grounds to believe that there is a risk of self-harm or harm to others, when a Residence Don receives a disclosure about sexual violence in a University residence, or when required by law.  The University may also disclose information to academic units when sanctions against students are imposed as set out expressly in this Policy.
6.3 Students seeking more confidential support are encouraged to contact Student Wellness Services or community resources listed on the [Sexual Violence Prevention and Response website](https://www.queensu.ca/sexualviolencesupport/support).
### 7\. Substance Use Amnesty
7.1.  The University acknowledges that students who experience sexual violence may be reluctant to disclose or submit a complaint if they were drinking or using drugs when an incident took place. The University will not discipline a student who discloses or complains about sexual violence for using drugs or alcohol at the time of the alleged incident. 
### 8\. Incident Response and Disclosure
Right to Disclose 
8.1. Any member of the university community may disclose their experience of sexual violence.
8.2. If there are immediate concerns about personal safety or security, students should contact Campus Security & Emergency Services (CSES) or call 9-1-1. If there is no immediate concern about personal safety or security, students should contact the SVPRS. 
Response to Disclosures 
8.3  The University will assess and respond appropriately to every disclosure with a view to maintaining a living, working, and learning environment free of sexual violence. Situations that are not within the scope of this policy may be handled under the University’s Harassment and Discrimination Policy or another University policy, as appropriate.
8.4 A disclosure is different from a complaint. The University recognizes that individuals often make disclosures in confidence and that, in many cases, confidentiality is essential for individuals to come forward. If a student chooses to disclose but does not want to report to the police or make a complaint under this policy, they remain entitled to access available personal supports and accommodations.
8.5 Students who have experienced sexual violence or sexual misconduct might initially disclose to a trusted faculty or staff member. The employee receiving a disclosure should listen, act in a caring, non-judgmental and supportive way, and maintain confidentiality unless the student making the disclosure grants permission to share or if the limits of confidentiality outlined in this policy apply. 
  a.    Any Student experiencing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) may seek support from the SVPRS, even if the IPV they are experiencing is non-sexual in nature.
8.6 All employees who are not health care providers and who receive a disclosure from a student shall: 
  a.    inform the student about this policy and the available support services; 
  b.    explain the limits of confidentiality, as outlined above; 
  c.    explain that the SVPRS can help by providing professional support and advice on options moving forward and encourage the student to contact the SVPRS; 
  d.    ask the student if they can share their name and contact information with the SVPRS;  
  e.    notify SVPRS without identifying the student via the [secure electronic means](https://queensu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_exNoPbhPE2iXxZz) available on the SVPRS website; and 
  f.    cooperate with the SVPRS to provide support and information to the student in a manner that respects the student’s wishes.
Employees should contact CSES or 911 immediately if there is an urgent safety risk to the student or others;
8.7 The SVPRS will: 
  a.    acknowledge receipt of notifications made by employees; 
  b.    offer support and provide information about available supports, resources, and options to students who identify themselves to the SVPRS as having made a disclosure; 
  c.    offer the same support and provide the same information to students who have not identified themselves to the SVPRS as having made a disclosure through employees who report disclosures.
8.8. University employees who are not health care providers should listen and express support without providing personal or emotional counselling.
8.9. University health care providers shall convey any disclosure of sexual violence to CSES, the police or another person as they believe to be necessary for the purpose of eliminating or reducing a significant risk of serious bodily harm.
### 9\. Immediate and Interim Measures
9.1. “Immediate Measures” are restrictions imposed on a student respondent, following a disclosure, relating to:  
•    the timing and manner of use of campus facilities, 
•    communications with another member of the community, and  
•    other privileges. 
The University may impose immediate measures for up to six weeks or the end of the current academic term.   Immediate measures may not include a prohibition on attending campus or classes. 
9.2. “Interim Measures” are restrictions on a student respondent imposed following the receipt of a complaint. The University ordinarily implements interim measures until it resolves a complaint (with no further right of appeal) and may prohibit attending campus and restrict class attendance as interim measures.
9.3. The University uses immediate and interim measures as reasonably necessary to provide those who make disclosures and complaints with an ability to participate in their normal activities with minimal direct contact with a respondent.
9.4. Immediate and interim measures are not punitive in nature. The University implements them without finding misconduct. Likewise, student respondents may agree to immediate and interim measures without acknowledging any misconduct. 
How to Request Immediate Measures 
9.5. An individual may request immediate measures without filing a complaint by contacting the SVPRS or a Residence Life Coordinator (for residence issues).
9.6 A Residence Life Coordinator and the SVPRS will promptly notify the Student Conduct Office of requests for immediate measures. A Residence Life Coordinator may implement immediate measures related to residence as they deem necessary.
How the University Implements Measures 
9.7. A case manager in the Student Conduct Office will determine what immediate or interim measures, if any, to implement and will review any temporary measures that have been implemented in Residence. 
9.8. Within two weeks of measures being imposed, the case manager will schedule separate meetings with the student who made the disclosure and the respondent to consider the need for and impact of the measures. The case manager may maintain, cancel, or modify, the measures already in place. 
9.9. The case manager may revisit the measures after the initial review if there is a significant change in circumstances or if there has been a breach or reprisal.
9.10 A case manager may refer matters to the Assessment and Care Team if concerned about the risk of harm. The Assessment and Care Team may implement measures or refer the matter back to the case manager. Only the Assessment and Care Team may cancel or modify measures that it implements.
9.11. Either party may request a meeting with the Associate Vice-Provost (Student Affairs) to discuss any alleged failure of administration by a case manager or the Assessment and Care Team.
Requests for Immediate Measures are Not Confidential 
9.12. An individual who asks for immediate measures without making a complaint waives confidentiality to the extent necessary to ensure procedural fairness and to implement any measures imposed. The University will, at a minimum, tell respondents that they are the subject of sexual violence allegations, describe the allegations to respondents and name the person making the allegations.
### 10\. Complaints and Procedural Protections
Scope of Complaint Procedure 
10.1. The complaint procedure set out below only applies if: 
  (i) the parties were both members of the university community at the time of the alleged incident; and 
  (ii) at least one of the parties was a student of the University at the time of the alleged incident; and 
  (ii) an individual makes the complaint when the respondent is a member of the university community.
10.2. If a respondent's relationship with the University ends before the University resolves a complaint the University may: 
  (i) suspend the procedure, with the option of reinstating it if the respondent re-joins the university community; or, 
  (ii) continue the procedure, whether or not the respondent participates.
10.3. If the respondent is a student, the Student Code of Conduct provisions regarding the impact of a pending case on the availability of transcripts, transcript notations, and the ability to withdraw will continue to apply until the University resolves the complaint.
10.4. The University will not accept anonymous complaints. The University does receive (via its online reporting platform) information about sexual violence from anonymous sources for its security purposes.
Commitment to Fairness 
10.5. Investigators and decision-makers will follow this policy and employ a fair process, including by: 
  (i) giving respondents sufficient information to allow them to understand the allegations, 
  (ii) providing respondents with a meaningful opportunity to respond; 
  (iii) allowing the use of support persons and advisors, including legal counsel; and 
  (iv) providing appropriate reasons for their findings and decisions.
Procedural Entitlements 
10.6. The University will ordinarily follow the complaint procedure, but may depart from it if fair, appropriate, or required by a collective agreement or statute.
10.7. The complaint procedure applies in place of procedural entitlements set out in other University policies, including the Student Code of Conduct, and the Student Academic Appeals Policy.
Participation in Complaint Process 
10.8. The University will not require anyone who has filed a complaint to participate in an investigation or any other part of the complaint procedure.  It is important to understand that a decision not to participate may change the outcome of any investigation or may preclude investigation. The Parties should also be aware that the University may be legally required to provide its files to the Crown Attorney in the event of criminal charges, or to the Court or others in the event of litigation, regarding the incident that is the subject of the complaint or disclosure.
### 11\. Complaint Procedure
How to File a Complaint 
11.1. Individuals may submit complaints to the Vice Principal (Culture Equity, and Inclusion) via the SVPRS.
11.2. Complaints need not include all of the details of the incident, but should set out the names of all known respondents, the allegations, and information about locations and dates.
Complaint Intake and Screening 
11.3. The Vice Principal (Culture, Equity, and Inclusion) may refer a complaint that involves two employees and is primarily a workplace matter to be handled pursuant to the Harassment and Discrimination Prevention and Response Policy.
11.4. A reviewer from the office of the Vice Principal (Culture, Equity, and Inclusion) will review all other complaints to determine if the allegations, if true, would result in a finding of sexual violence or sexual misconduct. If so, the reviewer will refer the complaint to investigation. If not, the reviewer may contact the person who made the complaint (or their designated contact) to request additional information. If the reviewer decides that there is insufficient information to meet this initial threshold, the reviewer will not refer the complaint to investigation.
Responsibility for Processing Complaints 
11.5. The office responsible for processing a complaint depends on status of the parties. The Student Conduct Office (“SCO”) is ordinarily responsible for processing complaints involving only student Respondents. The Office of Complaints and Investigations (the “OCI”) is ordinarily responsible for processing other complaints.
11.6 Each office will appoint an appropriate investigator. The OCI will do so in consultation with Faculty Relations or Employee & Labour Relations and will also determine who will receive and make decisions based on the investigator’s report.
11.7. Each office will appoint a case manager responsible for liaising with the investigator and the parties, keeping the parties apprised of material developments and providing status updates on at least a monthly basis.
11.8.  Once an Investigator is appointed, the individual who made the complaint shall be invited to provide a detailed statement to the investigator, but need not respond to the invitation or continue to participate in the process in any other way. 
11.9. Procedures under this Policy may be undertaken before, at the same time as, or after, civil, criminal, or professional or employment-related proceedings.  
11.10. If a complaint under this Policy relates to the same incident(s) as civil, criminal, or professional or employment-related proceedings against a student, the Associate Vice-Provost (Student Affairs) will determine whether the procedures under this Policy should be deferred until the conclusion, or partial conclusion, of such other proceedings.
### 12\. Complaint Resolution
Complaints Regarding Student Respondents 
12.1 Following the conclusion of the investigation, the investigator will create a report containing their findings of fact and conclusion as to whether or not the respondent has violated this policy. The case manager will provide a copy of the investigator’s report to the decision-maker and offer to provide a copy to the parties. The case manager may remove irrelevant personal information from the copy provided to the parties. 
12.2. The Associate Vice-Provost (Student Affairs) or a delegate will receive and make decisions based on the investigator’s report. 
12.3. The decision-maker will give the parties an opportunity to provide brief written input that addresses any concerns about the investigation process and conclusions, and if the investigator found a policy violation, on the question of sanction. The decision-maker may meet with each of the parties to obtain further input if the decision-maker believes it would be beneficial.
12.4. The decision-maker will accept the investigator’s conclusions unless a party establishes one or more of the following defects: 
  i.    the investigator demonstrated bias; 
  ii.    the investigator did not provide meaningful notice and a chance to respond; or 
  iii.    the conclusion is not reasonable based on the evidence or the investigator’s reasoning, as defined herein.
12.5. If a party establishes a defect, the decision-maker will either substitute a new conclusion or decide to direct the matter to a new investigator for re-investigation. 
12.6. If the decision-maker accepts that there has been a policy violation, the decision-maker will decide what penalty, if any, to impose. The decision-maker will impose appropriate sanctions considering:
* the nature and severity of the breach;
* the respondent’s acceptance of responsibility;
* the respondent’s record of misconduct;
* the impact on the person who made the complaint;
* the risk to re-offend;
* the principle of general deterrence; and
* any other relevant factors.
12.7. Sanctions may include any of the following, individually or in combination: 
  (i) a written warning or reprimand; 
  (ii) a letter of behavioural expectation; 
  (iii) educational assignments; 
  (iv) an apology; 
  (v) community service; 
  (vi) restitution; 
  (vii) a conditional or monetary fine; 
  (viii) loss of privileges; 
  (ix) a no-contact Directive; 
  (x) non-academic probation; 
  (xi) a notice of prohibition 
  (xii) suspension or expulsion; or 
  (xiii) sanctions delineated in the Residence Contract and Athletics and Recreation Non-Academic Misconduct Policy.
12.8. In addition to the sanctions above, the University may suspend or terminate the employment of students who are also employees of the University.
12.9. The decision-maker will provide a written decision (with reasoning) to the parties within two weeks of obtaining their input. 
Complaints Regarding Non-Student Respondents
12.10 The decision-maker identified in a collective agreement or otherwise appointed by the University will receive and make decisions based on the investigator’s report.
12.11. Prior to imposing a penalty for a policy violation, the decision-maker will confidentially consult the University offices responsible for security and labour relations and may confidentially consult with the head of any affected or potentially affected unit.
12.12. If there has been a policy violation, the decision-maker will decide what penalty, if any, to impose. The decision-maker will impose an appropriate penalty considering:
* the nature and severity of the breach;
* the respondent’s acceptance of responsibility;
* the respondent’s record of misconduct;
* the impact on the person who made the complaint;
* the principle of general deterrence; and
* all other relevant factors
12.13. The decision-maker will provide a written decision (with reasoning) to the parties.
### 13\. Appeals in Cases with Student Respondents
13.1. A party to a complaint decided by the Associate Vice-Provost (Student Affairs) may appeal to the Vice Provost and Dean of Students within ten business days of receiving the decision. They may do so by completing an appeal form and providing supporting documentation.
13.2 An appeal is not a re-determination and is not to address an investigator’s decision or procedure. A party may only raise the following grounds for appeal: 
  i.    the Associate Vice-Provost (Student Affairs)’s procedure was unfair and materially affected the outcome; or 
  ii.    the outcome is not reasonable based on the evidence before the Associate Vice-Provost (Student Affairs) or their reasoning.
13.3. The Vice Provost and Dean of Students will consider the written appeal and may seek clarification from the parties. They may then dismiss or allow the appeal in a written decision, with reasons. If they allow the appeal, they may substitute their own decision or ask the prior decision-maker to re-decide with the benefit of the reasoning set out in the appeal decision. 
13.4. The University will not implement sanctions until the time limit for an appeal has lapsed and until it has resolved any outstanding appeal.
13.5. When sanctions are implemented on a student enrolled in a program whose graduates are entitled to be recommended, certified, or otherwise admitted as members of a profession governed by the Regulated Health Professions Act or the Teaching Profession Act, the Dean of the student’s program shall be notified.  The Dean may request a summary of the factual findings and reasons, and may refer the matter for further consideration under any program or faculty policy with respect to professionalism.  The factual findings made under this Policy shall be considered conclusive evidence in any such professionalism proceeding.
### 14\. Sexual Misconduct
Principles 
14.1 A university is unique in that certain interactions and relationships between employees and students can involve heightened vulnerability for students. Students often depend on employees in circumstances in which a power imbalance is inherent and unavoidable.
14.2 Relationships between employees and students are a major component in the foundation of the University’s educational mission. Employees must approach them with integrity and professionalism. Employee-student relationships often also entail considerable trust in employees, particularly in those who regularly interact with students. 
14.3 Employees must ensure their relationships with students always remain professional. They must also be free of personal influence that could interfere with their responsibility for students’ learning and personal growth, both of which are integral to the student experience.
14.4 For these reasons, the University strongly discourages sexual or romantic relationships between employees and students and prohibits employees from engaging in such relationships if doing so would be sexual misconduct.
Prohibitions 
14.5 The University prohibits sexual misconduct, as defined in [Appendix 1](#Appendix 1) and in this section.
14.6 Subject to the provisions of section 14.8, a sexual or romantic relationship (even if consensual) between an employee and an undergraduate student is sexual misconduct unless: 
  (i)    both individuals in the relationship are students; 
  (ii)    the student is a second entry undergraduate student; or 
  (iii)    the relationship existed before a party to it became an employee or an undergraduate student.
14.7 A sexual or romantic relationship (even if consensual) between an employee and any student is sexual misconduct if the employee has any teaching, advising, supervisory, mentoring, evaluative, coaching, or other similar duties in respect of the student.
14.8 A sexual or romantic relationship (even if consensual) between an employee and any student is sexual misconduct if the relationship is between: 
  (i) a student athlete and employee in Athletics and Recreation; or,  
  (ii) a residence don and a student living in residence.
Employee Obligations Regarding Prohibited Conduct 
14.9 Employees must terminate all relationships prohibited by sections 14.6 and 14.8 on the date this policy becomes effective (January 2, 2024) Going forward, such employees must avoid the assumption of any teaching, advising, supervisory, mentoring, evaluative, coaching, or other similar duties in respect of the student.
14.10 Employees in a relationship prohibited section 14.7 on the date this policy becomes effective must promptly disclose a conflict of interest to their department head (or equivalent) or supervisor. The department head or supervisor and the employee will work together to resolve the conflict. Going forward, the employee must avoid the assumption of any teaching, advising, supervisory, mentoring, evaluative, coaching, or other similar duties in respect of the student.
14.11 Employees shall not assume any teaching, advising, supervisory, mentoring, evaluative, coaching, or other similar duties in respect of a student with whom they have had prior sexual or romantic relationship and must promptly disclose a potential conflict of interest to their department head (or equivalent) or supervisor. The department head or supervisor and the employee will work together to resolve the conflict.
14.12 Failure to meet an obligation set out in sections 14.9, 14.10 and 14.11 is sexual misconduct.
14.13 Individuals unsure about whether the University prohibits a relationship should seek guidance rather than fail to disclose. Employees may seek confidential input from the Sexual Violence Prevention and Response Services at [svpreducation@queensu.ca](mailto:svpreducation@queensu.ca). 
Consequences of Prohibited Conduct for Employees 
14.14 Sexual misconduct is subject to discipline up to and including termination from employment.
14.15 Despite any contrary term in an employment contract or collective agreement: 
  a.    discipline for sexual misconduct shall be deemed to have been imposed for just cause; 
  b.    no employee terminated for sexual misconduct is entitled to notice of termination or pay in lieu of notice or to any other compensation because of the termination, except as may be required by the Employment Standards Act; 
  c.    an employee terminated for sexual misconduct will not be re-employed by the University in any capacity.
University Obligations Regarding Sexual Misconduct 
14.16 The chair of a hiring committee will check with the human resources director for the position whether a job applicant who is to be short-listed for an interview has been terminated from employment with the University for sexual misconduct and, if so, will remove that applicant from the recruitment process.
14.17 If the University determines that it has re-employed a person whose employment it terminated for sexual misconduct under this policy, the University will terminate that employment. The termination will be deemed to have been imposed for just cause and the employee will not be entitled to notice of termination or pay in lieu of notice or to any other compensation because of the termination, except as may be required by the Employment Standards Act.
14.18 The University will not enter into any agreement that directly or indirectly prohibits it, or any person related to it, from disclosing that an allegation or complaint of sexual misconduct has been made against an employee.
14.19 Any community member who has reason to believe that sexual misconduct has occurred may submit a sexual misconduct complaint. The University will follow the complaint procedure, but individuals who are not the subject of misconduct will not have the status of a party.

### 19\. Effective date
19.1 This policy is in effect from the day the Board of Trustees approves it.

## APPENDIX 1 - GLOSSARY OF TERMS
The policy uses the following terms as defined below. 
**Consent**: an active, direct, voluntary and conscious choice and agreement to engage in sexual activity. For additional clarity: 
  (i) a person who is Incapacitated due to the consumption of drugs or alcohol or due to some other reason cannot give consent; 
  (ii) a person who has been threatened or coerced into engaging in sexual activity is not consenting to it; 
  (iii) the fact that consent was given in the past to a sexual, dating or intimate partner does not mean that consent can be assumed to be given for any future sexual activity; 
  (iv) consent may be compromised where individuals are in a position of power, trust or authority over the person whose consent is required; 
  (v) consent, once given, is revocable, at any time; 
  (vi) consent cannot be given on behalf of another person; and 
  (vii) consent is active and not passive or silent.
**(To) Disclose**: to share information about an incident of sexual violence with the University for the purpose of receiving support, counselling or accommodation, to request immediate measures, or to obtain information about how to make a complaint.
**Employee**: all individuals in an employment relationship with the University, all individuals in a contract with the University under which they provide services and all volunteers.
**Incapacity (Incapacitated)**: an inability to understand the sexual nature of the activity or appreciate the option of declining to participate in the activity.

**Indecent Exposure**: the exposure of the private or intimate parts of the body in a lewd or sexual manner, in a public place when the perpetrator may be readily observed. Indecent exposure includes exhibitionism.
**Intimate Partner Violence (IPV)**: is sometimes called spousal violence or domestic violence. All these terms refer to the ways that someone can cause harm to a current or ex-partner or spouse. IPV is any form of physical, sexual, emotional, or psychological abuse, including financial control, stalking, and harassment in person or online. It can occur between intimate partners of any gender or sexual orientation, who may or may not be married, common law, living together, or dating. It can also continue to happen after a relationship has ended. IPV impacts people of all genders, ages, socioeconomic, racial, educational, ethnic, religious, and cultural backgrounds.

To be reasonable, the decision must contain adequate reasons for the conclusions. A decision should be upheld if it falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes.
**Reprisal**: the act of penalizing, intimidating, or coercing an individual, whether directly or indirectly, for acting in good faith to carry out or assist with any step provided for in this Policy and includes threatening to do so. Engaging in an act of Reprisal constitutes a breach of this Policy.

 _https://www.queensu.ca/registrar/financial-aid/application-required/government/provinces-territories_

## Out-of-Province Interest-Free Status
If you are **receiving full-time government student financial aid** from your province for the current/upcoming study period, your lender (loan servicer) will automatically update your interest-free status based on the study period dates of your current government aid application once your application has processed and full-time enrolment is confirmed.
If you are **not receiving government student financial aid** from your province for the current/upcoming study period and are enrolled in a full-time course load, you are responsible to update your lender/service provider with your enrolment status. To avoid accruing irreversible interest on your previous government loans, the lender must be updated before your six-month grace period elapses. However, you must be enrolled in full-time studies at the time you submit your request and the request must be submitted prior to the end of your current study period. 
**We can only confirm full-time enrolment for the current study period.  We are not permitted to confirm enrolment for previous academic years.**
**Note:** If you apply for government student financial aid late or there is a delay in the processing of your current government funding application and you will not receive your first instalment at the start of your study period, we recommend you update your lender/service provider to avoid accruing interest.
Enrolment in a minimum 60% course load in each term of study (40% course load for students with a permanent disability) can reinstate the interest-free status on government student loans (discontinue payment) during the period of full-time enrolment. Students from outside the province of Ontario may consult the information outlined below for an explanation of how to submit a request for confirmation of enrolment for interest-free status. Ontario students may submit an online “[Continuation of Interest-Free Status (CIFS)](https://www.queensu.ca/registrar/financial-aid/application-required/government/osap/interest-free-status "Maintaining Interest-Free Status") Application” available via their account on the [OSAP website](https://www.ontario.ca/page/osap-ontario-student-assistance-program).
We recommend you follow up with your respective lender/service provider to ensure information has been received and interest-free status has been reinstated. Contact your Financial Aid and Awards if you have submitted a request and your interest-free status has not been reinstated (before your 6-month grace period elapses).

Approval: Senior Leadership Team

Date: May, 2021
Emergency Response: If you are experiencing or witness someone experiencing a severe allergic reaction and require immediate medical assistance: Call 911 and Campus Security & Emergency Services at 613-533-6111.
## Definitions
**Allergy[1](#Footnote 1)**: An allergy is a chronic medical condition involving an abnormal immune system reaction to an ordinarily harmless substance called an allergen. 
* Severe Allergy and Risk of Anaphylaxis: Allergies to food, insect stings, medication and other substances can trigger a potentially life-threatening anaphylactic reaction.  In Canada, the most common causes are food allergens (e.g. peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish (crustaceans, molluscs), egg,  milk, mustard, sesame, soy, wheat) and insect stings (e.g. wasps, honeybees, hornets, yellow jackets).[2](#Footnote 2)
**Anaphylaxis**: The most serious type of allergic reaction. Symptoms of anaphylaxis can vary for different people from one reaction to the next. Symptoms generally include two or more of the following body systems: Skin, Respiratory, Gastrointestinal and/or Cardiovascular. However, low blood pressure alone in the absence of other symptoms can also represent anaphylaxis.  
* **Skin**: hives, swelling (face, lips, tongue), itching, warmth, redness;
* **Respiratory** (breathing): coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest pain or tightness, throat tightness, hoarse voice, nasal congestion or hay fever-like symptoms (runny, itchy nose and watery eyes, sneezing), trouble swallowing; 
* **Gastrointestinal** (stomach): nausea, pain or cramps, vomiting, diarrhea; 
* **Cardiovascular** (heart): paler than normal skin colour/blue colour, weak pulse, passing out, dizziness or lightheadedness, shock; 
* **Other**: anxiety, sense of doom (the feeling that something bad is about to happen), headache, uterine cramps, metallic taste[3](#Footnote 3).  
Of the above anaphylaxis symptoms, trouble breathing and a drop in blood pressure are identified as the most dangerous and can lead to death if not immediately treated/if treatment is delayed. 
**Epinephrine**: The drug used to treat anaphylaxis. It is commonly delivered using an auto-injector.
* **Stock Epinephrine**: Term used to describe the availability of undesignated epinephrine auto-injectors.

# [Procedure for the Implementation of Targeted Hiring](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/administration-and-operations/targeted-hiring-policy/procedure-implementation-targeted) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/administration-and-operations/targeted-hiring-policy/procedure-implementation-targeted_

Final Approval Body: SLT
Senior Administrative Body with Responsibility: Associate Vice-Principal Human Rights, Equity and Inclusion
Date Initially Approved: July, 2022
## Purpose of Procedure
At Queen’s University, Targeted hiring initiatives aim to remove discriminatory barriers, redress under-representation, and improve opportunities for disadvantaged groups to achieve equal employment opportunities. Implementing these programs is one essential measure by which the university can advance its Indigenization, Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, Accessibility and Anti-racism (I-EDIAA) commitments.
Targeted hiring initiatives must follow the [Guidelines for developing special programs](https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/your-guide-special-programs-and-human-rights-code/guidelines-developing-special-program) issued by the Ontario Human Rights Commission. For this purpose, the procedure described below establishes the steps that academics and administrators must follow to launch a Targeted hiring initiative to remove access barriers, correct historical wrongs, and advance their I-EDIAA goals.
## Guiding Principles
The implementation of Targeted hiring programs at Queen’s shall be guided by
* the advancement of Inclusive Excellence,
* acknowledgment of the intersectionality of social identities, and
* substantial inclusion and engagement of Equity-deserving groups in developing Targeted hiring programs and other equity-related initiatives.
## Procedure
All academic and administrative units are expected to:
* consult with the HREO, Faculty Relations, and Human Resources when designing, implementing, and monitoring an Targeted hiring program.
* indicate the program’s rationale, supporting data, eligibility criteria, and evaluation method. 
* Complete and submit the [Commission’s checklist](http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/your-guide-special-programs-and-human-rights-code/special-program-guidelines-checklist) to the Office of the Provost (academic hiring) or the Office of the Vice-Principal Finance and Administration (VPFA) (staff hiring) for approval. Refer to Appendix A below.
* To create and retain a file of all information and evidence relied upon to justify the targeted recruitment for launching a Targeted hiring program.
* Follow the established Queen's University Equity Hiring process.
Ideally, the process of designing a particular program will comprise the following steps:
### Step 1 – Planning and consultation
Units are expected to consult with [groups or associations](https://www.queensu.ca/hreo/resources) that work to remove barriers for Equity-deserving group members to launch Targeted hiring opportunities. Additionally, units should become familiar with the existing [Targeted Hiring Policy](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/administration-and-operations/targeted-hiring-policy "Targeted Hiring Policy"), [Employment Equity Policy](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/human-resources/employment-equity-policy "Employment Equity Policy") and [Employment Equity Procedure](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/human-resources/employment-equity-policy/employment-equity-procedure "Employment Equity Procedure"). During this initial planning stage of the initiative, units are strongly encouraged to contact an equity advisor ([Client Intake Equity Form](https://www.queensu.ca/equity/client-intake-equity-form)).
### Step 2 – Collection and analysis of data
Units should review and explore data available to determine under-representation. For this purpose, units should contact the HREO to [request data](https://www.queensu.ca/equity/employment-equity/data-request-form) on representation rates. Data collected for Targeted hiring must be used **only** for the Targeted hiring program, and for no other purpose.
### Step 3 – Program Rationale
This is the reason for which the program is being created. In the rationale, units must identify who will benefit from the program, justify the targeted group(s) or subgroup(s), and explain how and why the program helps relieve hardship, economic disadvantage, inequality, or employment barriers. The rationale must also include the length of the program.
### Step 4 – Eligibility criteria
Targeted hiring programs must-have criteria that relate only to the program’s purpose. Units must set eligibility criteria that flow thoroughly from the rationale and are based on data supporting the need to restrict hiring to the targeted group or subgroup members.
### Step 5 - Method of identification
Units should provide a suitable method for determining the eligibility of candidates for whose benefit the Targeted hiring program is designed. The Queen’s Equity Appointments Process ([QEAP](https://www.queensu.ca/equity/sites/eqwww/files/uploaded_files/2019-10-29_QEAPManual.pdf)) is an innovative web application that collects, tracks, and reports employment equity data. Units can [request access](https://www.queensu.ca/equity/employment-equity/queens-equity-appointments-process-qeap), via an Employment Equity Representative, to the QEAP to determine representation gaps in the department.
### Step 6 – Job description and advertising
When implementing a Targeted hiring program, units may need to engage in a targeted recruitment strategy that actively attracts candidates of an under-represented demographic group. For Targeted hiring programs, the job description should include the rationale of the program, the eligibility criteria and the method of identification. The job description should be as broad as possible while noting the essential qualifications and experience. The advertising must use [inclusive language](https://www.queensu.ca/equity/sites/eqwww/files/uploaded_files/2020-10-28_standard%20EDI%20language%20for%20job%20descriptions.pdf) and a statement emphasizing that the job is under a Targeted hiring program. The hiring of Indigenous persons with specific sets of responsibilities related to their identity may be subjected to additional criteria or processes outlined by the Office of Indigenous Initiatives.
### 
Step 7 – Implementation plan
Units must develop a plan to implement a Targeted hiring program to recognize and maintain the dignity of the targeted group(s) and effectively retain the new employee/faculty.  The plan must address how Equity-deserving Group members will be integrated into the working environment in a way that will value their contributions and support their success.
### Step 8 – Monitoring and evaluation
Units must monitor the program periodically and evaluate the extent to which it ameliorates the disadvantage of its target group(s). The evaluations may include retention rates of employees from Equity-deserving Groups.
The steps described above may be adapted to meet each unit’s I-EDIAA goals and needs.

##### Queen’s University is situated on traditional Anishinaabe and Haudenosaunee Territory. To acknowledge this traditional territory is to recognize its longer history, one predating the establishment of the earliest European colonies. It is also to acknowledge this territory’s signiﬁcance for the Indigenous peoples who lived, and continue to live, upon it –people whose practices and spiritualities were tied to the land and continue to develop in relationship to the territory and its other inhabitants today. The Kingston Indigenous community continues to reﬂect the area’s Anishinaabek and Haudenosaunee roots. There is also a signiﬁcant Métis community and there are First Peoples from other Nations across Turtle Island present here today.

2. [Managing University Records](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/records-management/university-records)
3. Classify Records
The [Directory of Records](http://records-retention.library.queensu.ca/directory-records.php) provides a file classification scheme for the organization of university records in all media. Organized records are easy to file and to retrieve when needed.  Departments and units should use this scheme to develop a classification plan specific to their own records.  Using the pre-determined scheme has the advantage of being linked to the Records Retention Schedules which tell you how long to keep the records and when and how to dispose of them.
The file classification plan lists the records in a particular department or unit. It should be reviewed and updated regularly so that any new types or series of records are included and obsolete classifications are removed. The completed file classification plan tells everyone in the department or unit where to file documents in paper files and in electronic files and folders. In addition, it would be used for:
* creating labels for paper file folders in a paper filing system
* creating a shared directory structure for the unit
* creating a folder structure for email
* filing documents within paper and electronic files and folders

## Getting Set Up
### Your NetID
To log in to SOLUS, you will be asked to provide your **NetID** and **password.**
Some people, including alumni, may not remember their **NetID**, while others may never have been issued one while they were students.
The NetID is an issued combination of letters and numbers which is unique to each student. Think of it as your individual passkey to unlocking online services from Queen's.
If you don't have a **NetID**, you can [activate one.](https://netid.queensu.ca/identityiq/external/registration.jsf#/register)
This utility will require two things – one of which is your Student ID Number. If you do not remember your Student ID Number, you can contact the Office of the University Registrar at 613-533-6894. Once we have verified your identity by asking you a number of questions, we will provide you with your student number. In order to ensure your privacy, we will not provide student numbers by email.
**If you have your NetID, and don't remember your password, you can do either of the following:**
* If you created your Challenge Questions and supplied an Alternate Email Address, you can use the **[Self-Service Password Reset Tool](https://netid.queensu.ca/identityiq/external/registration.jsf#/register "link to Identity Manager")**
* If you did not create your Challenge Questions and did not supply an Alternate Email Address, you will have to contact the IT Support Centre by completing the **[Online Help Form](https://www.queensu.ca/its/apps/forms/itsc/helpform/)**
* * *
### Logging into the SOLUS Student Centre
1. Click on the "**Search and Sign In**" icon located in the top right-hand corner of Queen's affiliated websites
2. Select "**MyQueen'sU – SOLUS, MyHR and more**" from the revealed menu
3. Select the "**SOLUS**" link from the left hand column
4. Log in using your **NetID** and **password**
If you are planning on printing forms from SOLUS, please ensure that your web browser (Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Chrome) is set to allow pop-up windows.
SOLUS generates form requests by producing them in an Adobe pdf format in a new browser window. **If your browser is set to block pop-ups, then your forms will not appear on your computer.**
In order to help users be able to allow pop-ups, ITS has produced [instructions that list the steps involved for various compatible browsers](https://www.queensu.ca/its/software/supported-software/web-browsers/pop-ups/enabling-pop-ups-tutorial) for both the Mac and PC computing environments.
Your file should generate in PDF form in a new window, which you can save or print for your taxation records.
**If your file does not generate, please review steps 1 and 2 to ensure that your browser is allowing the new window to be created.**
## Managing Personal Information
The university relies on the contact information in your SOLUS profile for a number of activities. Listed below are easy steps to ensure that what we have is accurate and up-to-date.
**[Provincial law (FIPPA)](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90f31)** and **[University Senate policy](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/)** protect your right to privacy as well as restrict access to your personal information. The university will not release information on a student to a third party – including a parent or guardian – unless they have been given permission by the student. This can also be done via SOLUS by following the instructions below

**Supporting our People**, which is one the four strategic priorities in our [_Strategic Plan_](https://www.queensu.ca/artsci/sites/faswww/files/fas_strategic_plan_2019.pdf "(opens in a new window)"), is all about building and sustaining healthy learning and work environments that foster community, mental health, and well-being. When we developed our _Strategic Plan_, we committed to advancing this by **making wellness a priority** among FAS communities by:
* engaging culturally diverse practices of wellness with empathy, sensitivity and respect
* addressing structural inequalities that are barriers to well-being
* envisioning and developing environments for inspiration, creativity, professional development and continuous learning
This priority is essential to advancing our other priorities of strengthening our research prominence, enriching the student experience, and transforming our spaces, as well as **supporting our guiding principles**.
The need to advance the priority of supporting our people was amplified by the pandemic and is reflected in many of the themes that emerged from our Town Halls, Community Assembly meetings, Dr. Wendy Craig’s research into the impact of COVID-19 on the FAS community, and the resulting [Continuous Improvement Review for COVID Response.](https://www.queensu.ca/artsci/meet-the-dean/continuous-improvement-review-process-for-covid-response)  
We are continuing to build this section of our website, which starts with [Healthy Communities](https://www.queensu.ca/artsci/staff-and-faculty/support/healthy-communities).
This section of our website is dedicated to sharing information and resources related to our ongoing efforts to support our faculty and staff, and to continuing forward on our articulated pathways to strengthening and expanding our vision in the 21st century.
If you have suggestions for resources or initiatives, please contact Maryanne Wainman at [wainmanm@queensu.ca](mailto:wainmanm@queensu.ca).

3. PeopleSoft Student System
## Grade Entry
Queen's University uses PeopleSoft information systems to manage student records.
The following information will assist you in submitting and approving student grades. Please be sure to follow the appropriate links below so that the correct process is being used.
To submit grades from onQ, there are two requirements:
1. You must be listed as the primary instructor on the class; and
2. You must have the “Grader Role” assigned to you in PeopleSoft
To check to see if you have the “Grader Role,” go to:  
**Self-Service > Faculty Centre > Grade Roster**
If you are able to see this component, then you have the necessary access. 
If you are listed as the primary instructor but cannot access this component, check out the **PeopleSoft Student System Support** section below and submit an [online support form.](https://webapp.queensu.ca/its/PeopleSoftAccess/CampusSolutions/PSAccess.php)
### Department Head or Department Chair
Department Heads are responsible for grade approval online through PeopleSoft. Access to grade rosters for departmental approval will NOT be restricted to courses in a single department, so **Department Heads must take care to approve only grades for which they are responsible.**
Department Heads can refer to the following training materials:
* **[Training Wiki](https://wiki.queensu.ca/display/quasrsupport/QUASR+Training+Home "QUASR Training Wiki")** (Click on "Student Training")
* **[Approve Grade Roster](https://www.queensu.ca/registrar/node/133#peoplesoft-approve-grade-roster)**
* **[Run Grade Roster Status Report](#peoplesoft-grade-roster-status)**
### Course Instructors
Course Instructors are responsible for entering grades for students. This can be done by one of two methods: entering the grades directly into PeopleSoft through the Faculty Centre using "Grade Roster," or by uploading the grades to PeopleSoft from a spreadsheet.
In order to access the "Grade Roster" in PeopleSoft, follow this navigation:
**Self-Service > Faculty Centre > Grade Roster**
Course Instructors can refer to the following training materials:
* [Grade Entry using Self-Service](https://www.queensu.ca/registrar/resources/faculty-staff/peoplesoft#peoplesoft-grade-entry-self-service "PeopleSoft Student System")

* [How to Upload Grades using onQ](https://www.queensu.ca/onqsupport/grades)
### Department Assistants (or Other)
Department Assistants are responsible for a number of tasks related to grading in PeopleSoft. The tasks that you are responsible for will vary by department, but may include grade entry (done either through Grade Roster or Spreadsheet Upload), processing changes in grading, running a Grade Roster Status Report, and viewing student grades.
In order to access the "Grading" section in PeopleSoft, follow this navigation:
**Curriculum Management > Grading**
Department Assistants can refer to the following training materials:
* [Processing Changes in Grading](https://www.queensu.ca/registrar/resources/faculty-staff/peoplesoft#peoplesoft-changes-grading "PeopleSoft Student System")

       2. To view your Class Schedule sign into PeopleSoft and select Faculty Centre
       3. You can find information about other courses using the **Search** function
    4. Choose the term for the search from the drop down menu
    5. Choose the **Department** from the drop down menu. You can enter a course number to look at a specific course or view an entire department at once
    6. Only 3 sections display at once. If you are looking at a course with multiple sections, choose **View all sections**
**Note:** When viewing a class list, duplicate names show if a student is either in a dual degree program or a MJM, Medial, etc.
* To view the class list without duplicates, save the report as an Excel file, and then remove duplicates by student ID number
### 1\. Create Grade Rosters in Batch
The Office of the University Registrar (OUR) creates **Grade Rosters** for all classes to allow submission of grades.
* **Grade Rosters** act as online grade entry sheets; they are used to record, approve, and post grades in classes for students
* **Grade Rosters** will be produced just prior to the grading period so that all add/drops are reflected on the roster
* * *
### 2\. Grade Entry
**Instructors** will enter grades directly using the **Grade Roster** by navigating to **Self-Service**, **Faculty Centre**, **Grade Roster** component pages or, by uploading grades from a spreadsheet.
* * *
### 3\. Grade Approval
Approval of grades will be done by Department Heads online.
* Access to **Grade Rosters** for departmental approval will not be restricted to courses in a single department so Department Heads must take care to approve only grades in classes for which they are responsible
* * *
### 4\. Mid-Year Grades
Multi-term (A/B) courses are offered over two consecutive terms, typically fall and winter.  In order to help first year students gauge how they are doing in a multi-term course, mid-year grade rosters will be created for all 100-level multi-term courses and instructors will be asked to submit grades for year 1 students only.
* Mid-year grades will be entered in the mid-year grade roster created for the fall term portion of the course. This grade does NOT appear on the student’s transcript
* **A grade of NG (Not Graded)** will be entered in batch by the OUR on the fall term portion of the course. This is what will appear on the student’s transcript
* The final grade for the multi-term course will be entered on the winter term portion of the course
* * *
### 5\. Non-Evaluative Grades
The range of grades, as follows, will be assigned in a consistent manner across faculties.
**Incomplete Grade (IN)** – A single **Incomplete Grade of IN** will be assigned only in cases where the student would otherwise receive a failing grade if the outstanding work is not completed, or a deferred examination is not written. If the outstanding work is not submitted or the exam is not written, this grade will automatically lapse to an F at the end of the following term, unless the student successfully appeals (usually to the Faculty Office) for an extension or to drop the course. Some faculties may recommend, or require, the instructor to fill in a separate form outlining the conditions under which the **IN** is being submitted and send it to the Faculty Office for the student’s records before an **IN** grade is approved.
If the student would otherwise still receive a passing grade in the course, the actual grade earned will be submitted. A change of grade will then be submitted when the outstanding work has been completed or, the exam has been written. Again, some faculties may recommend, or require, the instructor to fill in a separate form outlining the conditions under which such a grade is being submitted.
**Grade Deferred (GD**) - The **Grade Deferred (GD)** use is limited under faculty regulations (usually to those cases where an academic integrity investigation is outstanding) and it will not lapse automatically.
**Credit (CR)** – **Credit standing (CR)** in a course is available only upon appeal by the student to the Faculty Office, so individual instructors will not be able to enter this grade.
Mark Condition: **Aegrotat (AG**) Standing – The Aegrotat (estimated) standing in a course is available only upon appeal by the student to the Faculty Office.
* * *
### 6\. Grade Changes
Changes of grade are initiated by instructors to correct an error or to update the grade of a student with an “**Incomplete**” grade.
* Grade changes may be submitted through the Change of Grade module in PeopleSoft or by using the [Change of Grade Form](https://www.queensu.ca/registrar/node/82#grade-forms). Grade changes are approved by the Department Head and Faculty Office
* In cases where students experience extenuating circumstances that may justify a grade adjustment, students may submit an appeal to the Faculty Office for review
Grades may be uploaded from an Excel spreadsheet by both instructors and administrative staff directly to the **Grade Roster.**
When complete, the **Grade Roster** will need to be marked as “**Ready for Review.”**
### Accessing the Excel Spreadsheet Template for its Intended Use
1. Begin by clicking on the **Main Menu** and follow the navigation: 
 **Reporting Tools > Query > Query Viewer**
2. On the **Query Viewer** page, enter the **Query Name** or partial name in the search field

### Modify the Excel Spreadsheet Template for its Intended Use
In the Excel spreadsheet, Columns **A** through to **H** are required for the **Grades Spreadsheet Upload** process.
7. Sort the file so that all Students ID’s are in **Ascending** order. Compare this list with your list or file. There should be a one- to-one match on Student ID’s between both files
8. Use Column **H – Grade** to enter your marks. You can enter either a letter or numeric mark on this spreadsheet
 * **Note:** Letter grades must be entered in upper case
**Save** the file.
Once you have completed entering the marks, into the Excel spreadsheet and have reviewed the data entry to ensure it is final, you are ready to upload the marks.
### Prepare the Excel Spreadsheet Template for Loading
9. **Delete** the header rows on the spreadsheet; there should be no column headings
 * **Note:** To use this process, you must delete any values in columns I onwards; if the columns are not blank, your upload will not work
10. Save the file as a **Text (Tab- delimited)** file for uploading into PeopleSoft
 * Give the file a meaningful name. We suggest a combination of Subject, Course Number, and Instructor Name i.e. CHEE452 Davis
 * **Note for Mac Users:** To save as a Text (Tab delimited) file, open the file using Text Wrangler, and save the file as per the naming convention above. Remember to select the option for line breaks to Windows
* * *
### Prepare the Grade Roster for the Upload

## System Support
In order for the Office of the University Registrar to ensure that every issue is recorded and directed to the most appropriate person for follow-up in a timely manner, all support requests should be made directly to the PeopleSoft Student System Support Centre by using the online form.
This "one-window" model of support allows us to provide the most efficient service we can to the entire Queen's community. It offers a better coordinated method of issue tracking, with the following benefits:
* Every support issue is centrally recorded for follow-up in our online issue tracking system, known as **iTrack**
* Your issue is directed to the most appropriate person for response; and
* The high volume of support requests is managed in the most efficient way, ensuring that you get the help you need as quickly as possible
[**PeopleSoft Student Systems Access Request Form (Security)**](https://www.queensu.ca/its/apps/PeopleSoftAccess/CampusSolutions/PSAccess.php)
**[PeopleSoft Student Support Issue Tracking Form (iTrack)](https://www.queensu.ca/itrack/student/StudentSupport.php)**
### Contacting the PeopleSoft Student System Support Centre Process
* Please fill out the online form with as much detail as possible, and submit it
* Your issue will be recorded in **iTrack** and you will receive an email assigning an Issue Number for future reference
* The issue is automatically assigned to the expert within the Registrar's Office who is best equipped to resolve the issue
* If your problem cannot be resolved at this level, it will be transferred to a staff member who has further expertise in the PeopleSoft system and/or the business area related to your issue
### Blank Page on Term Activate a Student Page
When a student applies for a career, a blank page is created in **Records and Enrolment > Student Term Information > Term Activate a Student.**
This blank page will remain until the student is matriculated. Because the page is blank, it may seem that there is a problem with the record, but this is normal.
It may seem even more confusing if the student has already been accepted to Queen's (as, for example, an Undergraduate).
When that student applies to a Graduate career, the blank page will appear as the first record, again making it seem like there is a problem.
If the student is never accepted as a Grad Student, that page will always remain there. ​
* * *
### Distinguishing Courses by Program when Auditing a Transcript of a Dual Degree Student
The courses are not distinguished by program on a transcript. The transcript simply displays all courses taken in a term.
To see which courses are attached to one of multiple degree programs, go to the **Enrolment Summary** page (**Records and Enrolment > Enrolment Summaries > Enrolment Summary**), put in the student number and term, and the courses listed will show the applicable Academic Program.

# [Plan Selection | Queen's University Faculty of Arts and Science](https://www.queensu.ca/artsci/undergrad-students/first-year-students/plan-selection) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/artsci/undergrad-students/first-year-students/plan-selection_

Students who have completed 24 units or more must participate in the Program/Plan selection process in May.  This involves choosing the area of study (plan) that you wish to pursue.  For some students this may involve requesting to change your degree program.  For example, students may request a change of degree program from:
* Bachelor of Arts Honours (BAH)  to Bachelor of Science Honours (BSCH) or Bachelor of Computing Honours (BCMPH)
* BCMPH to BAH or BSCH
* BSCH to BAH or BCMPH
NOTE:  Students who were admitted to the following programs do not participate in plan selection:  Bachelor of Fine Art, Bachelor of Music, Bachelor of Physical and Health Education; or Bachelor of Science in Kinesiology.
For more information on degree programs offered in Arts and Science, please visit the [Academic Calendar](https://www.queensu.ca/academic-calendar/arts-science/schools-departments-programs/).
To request your Program/Plan, log into your Student Centre in SOLUS.  Program/Plan Selection is NOT first-come first-served and you may access the page as often as you wish.  Please keep in mind, though, that each time you are accepted into a plan, a record of that change will be recorded on your student record and transcript. 
If you need help navigating SOLUS please visit [this link](http://queensu.ca/registrar/resources/registration-guides/2020-2021/solus-guide).
All plans in Arts and Science have minimum academic requirements that a student must satisfy in order to be admitted to that plan.  To view the thresholds for all plans in Arts and Science please visit your department page and see the "What it takes" handout under Degree Plans and Options.
Each plan will have an automatic acceptance threshold and a pending list threshold. Once you have decided which plan you wish to pursue, access SOLUS to request that plan.  Be sure to enter your desired plan first.  When you enter your request one of three outcomes will occur:
* **Automatically Accepted -** If you meet the automatic threshold for the plan you have requested you will receive a message on SOLUS telling you that you have been accepted into your plan.  Once accepted, your plan information in SOLUS will be updated and a new entry denoting the change will be recorded on your SOLUS record and transcript. Every time you request a plan change and are accepted to a different plan, a new entry will be recorded on your SOLUS record and on your transcript. 
* **Placed on a Pending (waiting) list**\- If you receive a message on SOLUS telling you that you have been placed on a pending list this means that your request will be manually reviewed by the department following the Plan Selection period (see below). In addition to being informed that you are on a pending list, SOLUS will also inform you that you must select an alternate plan that you can be automatically accepted to.
 
 Students can only be on one pending list.  If you are placed on a pending list, you must choose an alternate plan that you are automatically accepted in to.  If you choose to leave SOLUS without being automatically accepted to a plan, you will be removed from the pending list.  If you do not participate in plan selection you run the risk of not getting into the plan of your choice.  It is critical that you are automatically accepted into a plan before the Plan selection period ends.  Otherwise, you will not be able to register in your classes in July.
 
 Following the Plan Selection process on SOLUS, departmental administrators will manually review all students on their pending lists.  If a department accepts you from their pending list, your plan information in SOLUS will be updated and a new entry denoting the change will be recorded on your SOLUS record and transcript. **You will receive an email once the department makes their decision**.
 
 **REMEMBER:** Departments will be reviewing their pending lists the week following Plan Selection so you may not see a change to your plan until after that date.
 
* **Refused Admission for that Plan**?  If you do not meet the minimum requirements for the plan you want, please consider the following strategies:

1. Academic Integrity
2. Appealing an Academic Integrity Decision
 [Appealing an AI Decision (234KB | PDF)](https://www.queensu.ca/ombuds/sites/ombwww/files/uploaded_files/TipSheets/AcademicIntegrity_Appealing_a_Decision.pdf)
Queen’s students, faculty, and staff all have responsibilities, through the [Senate Policy on Academic Integrity](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/senate/academic-integrity-policy) for supporting and upholding the fundamental values of academic integrity: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility and courage. The [Senate Policy on Academic Integrity Procedures](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/senate/academic-integrity-procedures-requirements-faculties-schools) outlines certain procedural requirements of Faculties & Schools surrounding any investigation into an academic integrity concern. While there are slight variances between Faculties & Schools all students must have an opportunity to appeal an academic integrity decision, should they meet the grounds.
**What can be appealed?** Students may appeal the finding, the sanction, or both.
[Review Section 4 (Appeals) of the **Academic Integrity Procedures – Requirements of Faculties**](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/senate/academic-integrity-procedures-requirements-faculties-schools)
The grounds for submitting an appeal are limited to cases in which a student is able to establish:
1. A breach of procedural fairness, which could include such things as failing to:
 * Permit a student to be heard by an unbiased decision-maker.
 * Follow applicable rules, regulations, or university policy in a way that adversely affected a student’s right to a fair process.
 * Make a reasonable decision. A “reasonable” decision is one that is rational in that its findings are based on evidence, thought out and supported by facts and logical inferences from findings of fact. To be reasonable, the decision must contain adequate reasons for the conclusions. A decision should not be overturned if it falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes. If the decision is “reasonable”, the decision-maker deciding the appeal is not permitted to substitute their opinion for that of the decision-maker whose decision is under appeal. 
  
2. The decision-maker whose decision is being appealed acted without, or exceeded their, jurisdiction. (e.g. an instructor imposes a sanction which is only available to the School AI Lead, such as a requirement to withdraw.)
Each Faculty or School regulation or procedure with respect to academic integrity matters sets out their own levels of appeal. In addition to the level(s) of appeal within each Faculty or School, the **[Senate Student Academic Appeals Policy](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/senate/student-academic-appeals-policy)** establishes the University Student Appeal Board (USAB), with jurisdiction to hear appeals of the final academic integrity decision made within each Faculty or School. Generally, the appeal levels are as follows\*:
**Original Decision Maker**
 
**Appeal Body**
**Instructor**
**Faculty/School AI Lead 
_ie. Associate Dean_**
**Faculty/School AI Lead 
_ie. Associate Dean_**
**Faculty/School AI Panel**
**Faculty/School AI Panel**
**University Student Appeal Board (USAB)**
_\*Students should refer to their Finding of Departure notice and must review the academic integrity policy for their Faculty or School for more detailed information on the next appropriate appeal level._
If you are confident your appeal does indeed meet one of the **grounds** for appeal, you will need to submit your appeal within **10 business days** of the date that the _Finding of Departure_ form was e-mailed by the decision-maker. If a decision on remedy or sanction was referred to the AI Lead the appeal cannot be submitted until a remedy or sanction is assigned. In such cases, the appeal must be submitted within 10 business days of the date that the notice of the remedy or sanction imposed was emailed to the student by the AI Lead.
The submission of the appeal generally includes the following\*:
* A copy of the Finding of Departure form that states the remedy or sanction decision
* A written appeal letter explaining the reasons for your appeal and the ground(s) for appeal
* Any additional supporting documents
If the appeal contains new evidence that is permitted, the appeal decision-maker shall have no jurisdiction over the appeal and shall send the matter back to the previous decision-maker for reconsideration, unless:
* the delay of sending the matter to the prior decision-maker would be unduly prejudicial to the student; or
* the student’s new evidence clearly demonstrates bias in the prior proceeding that otherwise cannot be remedied.
_Students should refer to the academic integrity policy for their Faculty or School for more detailed information on submitting the appeal._
This letter is not a re-telling of the case, but your opportunity to identify what was faulty in the process followed by the previous decision-maker(s).
**Introduction**
Consider your audience and provide an short opening introduction that summarizes your concern. This section should state clearly whether you are appealing the finding, the remedy or sanction, or both. A meeting is part of this process, but you may indicate you do not want to meet, and proceed based on written submissions only.
**Grounds for Appeal**
This section should provide a clear and concise explanation that summarizes **what** the reason(s) for appeal are and also clearly identifies the ground(s) for your appeal.
Your appeal letter should begin by saying what you’re appealing and provide a brief summary as to what the **ground(s)** are. Note that you will go into more detail when speaking about the underlying facts you have to support the ground(s).
For example, if you decide to appeal because you feel there was a breach of procedural fairness, you would say _“I am appealing the academic integrity finding and sanction that resulted in my grade of zero on the grounds of a breach of procedural fairness,”_ and then briefly explain what was the breach of procedural fairness. Ensure you review the flip-side of this document to understand what a breach of procedural fairness could include.
**Underlying Facts**
This section would detail the facts that support the ground(s) of appeal that have been identified. This can be thought of as the **“how”** of the appeal letter. For example, if a breach of procedural fairness occurred due to a biased decision-maker, you would include the facts that support **how** the decision-maker was biased in making the decision.

1. [Research Resources](https://www.queensu.ca/vpr/resources)
2. Indigenous Research
Indigenous research is conducted by or with First Nations, Inuit, Métis or other Indigenous societies and individuals while engaging with Indigenous knowledge systems in a culturally appropriate manner. It addresses issues relevant to Indigenous peoples and results in meaningful outcomes that benefit them directly. Knowledge gathering grounded in Indigenous ways of being arises in relationship to the land, language, community and all beings. In adhering to the principles such as respect, relevance, reciprocity, and responsibility (Kirkness & Barnhardt, 1991), Indigenous research projects facilitate the enactment of relational accountability which is fundamental to building strong research partnerships.
The importance of Indigenous research is firmly embedded in key institutional documents such as  [_Strategic Research Plan 2018-2023 (PDF 145 KB)_](https://www.queensu.ca/indigenous/sites/oiiwww/files/uploaded_files/\(WEB%20VERSION\)%20Final%20Report%20of%20the%20Truth%20and%20Reconciliation%20Commission%20Task%20Force.pdf). Both documents assert Queen’s commitment to the codes of research practice that are grounded in informed consent and reciprocal relationships with Indigenous communities, expressed in the phrase “Nothing about us without us.” 
 
### Bridging the Policy-Practice Gap: In Search of a New Model of Indigenous Research Ethics Review at Queen’s University
This report summarizes the findings of the qualitative research which explored options for designing a new Indigenous research-related ethics review model at Queen’s. The research methods included an online survey questionnaire distributed to Queen’s faculty members who collaborate with Indigenous communities, and remote, in-depth interviews with key internal knowledge holders (Indigenous and settler researchers, students, staff supporting Indigenous initiatives, REB members, ethics office staff), and external experts (members of the Tri-Agency Reference Group for the Appropriate Review of Indigenous Research and SSHRC’s Indigenous Advisory Circle).

## Canadian Disability Policy Alliance (CDPA)
[The Canadian Disability Policy Alliance (CDPA)](http://www.disabilitypolicyalliance.ca/) is a national collaboration of 14 researchers in disability studies from 4 Canadian universities, 5 disability advocacy organizations, and consultants from federal and provincial governments.  Since July 2009, the Alliance has conducted 27 research projects, aimed at evaluating and improving disability policy in Canada.
As of July 2013, the CDPA has completed 4 years of its five-year research agenda.  In partnerships between researchers and disability advocates, we have undertaken projects covering a wide variety of issues affecting people with disabilities, including education, employment, health care, and civic engagement.
Over the coming year, we propose to disseminate these research findings to individuals and organizations involved in disability issues, such as yourself.  We hope some of this information may help you to continue to achieve meaningful change for people with disabilities in Canada.  Please feel free to share or use anything we send you.
The CDPA employs a unique methodology for emancipatory research and knowledge mobilization, known as the **Learning Collaborative**. Derived from research on health system improvement, the Learning Collaborative focuses on small but meaningful increments of change that can be readily achieved and studied, then expanded to effect broader outcomes.
   [The Learning Collaborative: An approach to emancipatory research in disability studies (PDF - 512 KB)](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/sites/ahwww/files/uploaded_files/research/CJDS-Article-200113.pdf)
In an effort to assist policy makers and policy analysts to reflect on the adequacy of policy for disabled Canadians, we developed the Disability Lens, a series of questions derived from “tips for policy analysis” _(in McColl and Jongbloed, 2006._ Disability and social policy in Canada, 2nd ed.) These questions are intended to provide a quick, easy guide to assessing the important implications of policy decisions for people with disabilities.

## Regional Assessment and Resource Centre (RARC)
Part of the mandate of the [Regional Assessment and Resource Centre (RARC)](http://www.queensu.ca/rarc) is to engage in systematic, multidisciplinary research. Our research focuses on adult assessment and outcomes for persons with specific learning or attention disorders. Findings from our research efforts help ensure that students receive an accurate diagnosis of their difficulties so that appropriate treatments and supports can be put in place. We are also interested in determining which transition supports and services have the most beneficial impact for students as they transition to post-secondary studies and also into the workforce.

## How We Disclose Your Personal Information
A student’s parents or guardian do not have a right to access to the student’s information. Students wishing the university to release financial and/or academic information to an individual, including a parent, or to an agency external to the university must provide their consent in SOLUS. **Such authorization will be effective until the student cancels the authorization**. For instructions on how to assign authorizations, please visit the [SOLUS Help page](https://www.queensu.ca/registrar/resources/solus-help#release-personal-information).
Specified records or portions thereof may be provided where required by law, such as:
* to persons or agencies pursuant to a court order, summons, or subpoena directing the university to release information;
* in accordance with the requirements of duly constituted professional licensing and certification bodies; and
* in accordance with Section 42(1) of the [Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90f31#BK66).
Personal information may be disclosed to ministries and agencies of the Ontario Government and the Government of Canada as required by statute or regulation. This includes transfers to entities such as Statistics Canada and the Ministry of Colleges and Universities as described below.
Your personal information may also be shared with the following external organizations and groups:
Students become members of the Alma Mater Society (AMS) or the Society of Professional and Graduate Students (SGPS) when they pay student activity fees. Students may opt out of certain fees which denies them access to specific services/activities. The university may disclose students’ personal information to various student organizations, under an information-sharing agreement, in order to allow for their participation in elections and other operations. In particular, personal information—including name, student number, email address, degree program, and academic plan—is disclosed to and may be used by organizations such as the Alma Mater Society of Queen's University, the Arts and Science Undergraduate Society, the Engineering Society, the Commerce Society, and the Society of Graduate and Professional Students for purposes such as the following: identifying and contacting students to provide them with access to student society membership and information about affiliated or sponsored programs, services, and activities; for verification and validation of voters for society referenda and elections; for the administration of the non-academic discipline system; and for communicating with members about student society matters. 
Personal information of students may be provided by the university to the Health and Dental Plan carriers in accordance with the Memoranda of Agreement and Understanding between the carriers and the student societies, AMS and SGPS, and between the carrier and the Queen's University International Centre. AMS and SGPS administrators may also use birthdate, gender, and academic concentration data of dental and health plan participants. If you have any questions or require additional information, please contact the **AMS Commissioner of Internal Affairs** at 613.533.6000, extension 74815, or the **SGPS Administrator.** 
Statistics Canada is the national statistical agency. As such, Statistics Canada carries out hundreds of surveys each year on a wide range of matters, including education. 
It is essential to be able to follow students across time and institutions to understand, for example, the factors affecting enrolment demand at post-secondary institutions. The increased emphasis on accountability for public investment means that it is also important to understand 'outcomes'. In order to conduct such studies, Statistics Canada asks all colleges and universities to provide data on students and graduates. Institutions collect and provide to Statistics Canada student identification information (student's name, student ID number, Social Insurance Number), student contact information (address and telephone number), student demographic characteristics, enrolment information, previous education, and labour force activity.
The _**[Federal Statistics Act](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/S-19/index.html)**_ provides the legal authority for Statistics Canada to obtain access to personal information held by educational institutions. The information may be used only for statistical purposes, and the confidentiality provisions of the _**[Statistics Act](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/S-19/index.html)**_ prevent the information from being released in any way that would identify a student.
Students who do not wish to have their information used can ask Statistics Canada to remove their identifying information from the national database. On request by a student Statistics Canada will delete an individual's contact information (name, address, or other personal identifiers) from the Postsecondary Student Information System (PSIS) database. To make such a request, please contact:

# [History of University Council | University Secretariat and Legal Counsel](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/university-council/history-university-council) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/university-council/history-university-council_

## How did Council start?
**_(This may seem unrelated, but I promise we’ll get to University Council if you stick with it!)_**
In the late 1860s, a number of Presbyterian and Free churches in Ontario, Quebec, and the Maritimes chose to unite.  Queen’s Principal at the time, Rev. William Snodgrass, played an important role in advising the Ontario body given that Scottish churches were significant benefactors of the university as it educated young men in divinity.  
Some stakeholders felt that there was no role for the church to play in secular education and that Queen’s should amalgamate with the University of Toronto and shutter the Kingston campus.  Some proposed that Queen’s, which was providing an education in the arts and sciences as well as divinity, be restricted to only offering religious instruction.
After four years of work, it was agreed that the united Presbyterian Church in Canada would provide a grant to assist in funding theological education at Queen’s, but that its involvement in secular education be limited.
**_(If you’ve stuck with it, this is the moment you’ve been waiting for…)_**
University Council was created near the end of this work, in 1874, likely in reaction to the lessened influence of the Church and the growing influence of Queen’s graduates, given that the university had now existed for over 30 years and a good number of alumni had Queen’s interests at heart.  There was a desire to bring together a group of people with strong connections to Queen’s who could encourage donations and help the university find its way in this new chapter of its existence.
