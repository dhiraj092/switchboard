# [A Taste of Canada - Rakka Rakkappan - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/a-taste-of-canada-rakka-rakkappan/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/a-taste-of-canada-rakka-rakkappan/_

Rakka Rakkappan may have found the path to happiness and he is sharing the news with the world.
Rakka is a serial entrepreneur who immigrated from India in 2005. His entrepreneurial journey began when, with support from friends and family, he launched himself into the IT consulting business in Kingston – a location he saw as being the perfect middle ground between Toronto and Ottawa.
Seven years later, after discovering how difficult it can be to land government contracts when you are not a ‘preferred vendor’, Rakka switched gears and tried his hand at real estate and mortgage lending. It finally dawned on him that the downfall of service businesses is they only work as long as you have time to sell.
“It’s easy to make money – the secret is finding a way to make time,” he said. “Living in a smaller city like Kingston helps. But if you’re a product company, rather than a service company, you can be in any country you want and be as big as you want.”
In 2016, he acquired an automotive garage to open Maple Car Wash – partly to service taxis he had acquired and partly to provide office space. That business took on a life of its own and Rakka now offers limousine services and related products.
Still, Rakka’s dream was to create a global product brand he and his wife Uma could own. But what to focus on? Inspiration hit during a popular local pastime.
“I was watching a hockey game and drinking a mass-produced beer and I was not really enjoying it,” he said. “You shouldn’t be chugging your beer. You should be sipping it and enjoying it like you would a glass of wine. It should be an experience.”
Thus, Maple Sports Ale was born. The unique beverage is brewed and sold in both Ontario and Belgium, and available for sale in the United States and India. In the future, Rakka hopes to bring the beer to Australia and the United Kingdom though it has already made a trip to the British Isles.
During the 2019 Worldwide Beer Awards held in London, Maple took bronze in the Belgian ale category. “For a twoyear-old company, that’s pretty good,” Rakka said. “We’re hoping to up our game and win gold next time. It’s not marketed as a premium beer, but those who enjoy it can decide for themselves.”
Rakka aims to supplement his Belgian ale with a lager and is expanding into other beverage markets. He has started a bottled water line under the Maple name and is also importing wines from South Africa and Australia.
“We are looking for some space to eventually open a vineyard and brewery in the Kingston or Prince Edward County area and we hope to export Ontario wines in the future,” he said.
Rakka has also begun exporting the most Canadian of condiments: maple syrup.
“Obviously, with our name, we wanted to add something sweet to our lineup,” he said. “We produce a darker syrup unlike what you would normally find in the grocery store.”
Rakka has learned a few lessons during his many business ventures. While not all of his ideas have been successful, he realized he could impart his wisdom to other prospective entrepreneurs to help them avoid some of the costly mistakes he made along the way.
One of his major projects for 2020 was a free educational website called www.lifesquares.ca.
“If I can even save one person some time and money, it’s worth the investment for me,” Rakka says. “Everyone can be an entrepreneur as long as you have the right drive and as long as you are happy!”

# [Kingston Economic Development Corporation Wins Gold Award for Excellence in Economic Development - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/kingston-economic-development-corporation-wins-gold-award-for-excellence-in-economic-development/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/kingston-economic-development-corporation-wins-gold-award-for-excellence-in-economic-development/_

Kingston, Ontario – October 6, 2021 – Kingston Economic Development Corporation won a Gold Rank for its Queen’s Career Apprenticeship: Kingston, a project in the category of Partnerships with Educational Institutions from the International Economic Development Council (IEDC) 2021 Excellence in Economic Development Awards Program. The honour was announced on October 5, 2021 during the IEDC Annual Conference in Nashville, Tennessee.
“Addressing workforce challenges and retaining young talent in our community is critically important to Kingston’s immediate and future needs. This unique program, which was piloted in Kingston has realized tremendous success with a value proposition equally important to the community as it is to students,” says Donna Gillespie, CEO, Kingston Economic Development Corporation. “This award shows the importance of collaboration with post-secondary institutions to address gaps in the community.”
“It has been amazing to see this program grow over the last three years and exciting to see other universities nationwide have adopted similar apprenticeship programs,” says Dean Barbara Crow, Faculty of Arts and Science at Queen’s University. “Experiential learning is a key piece of the university experience and has a direct impact on our students’ ability to source jobs while benefitting the local economy by ensuring these Queen’s students remain within the Kingston community.”
“We have businesses that need talented people, and we have talented arts grads that need jobs, but there is a gap between those two things,” notes Gillian Watters, Kingston Economic Development Corporation’s Board Chair and Director of Programs at KEYS Employment Services. “This program provides a real career opportunity for arts graduates and helps with mentoring support and funding incentives. It’s a win-win for employers and for graduates and a huge win for Kingston.”
IEDC’s Excellence in Economic Development Awards recognize the world’s best economic development programs and partnerships, marketing materials, and the year’s most influential leaders. 25 award categories honour organizations and individuals for their efforts in creating positive change in urban, suburban, and rural communities. Awards are judged by a diverse panel of economic and community developers, following a nomination process held earlier this year. IEDC received over 500 submissions from 4 countries.
“The winners of IEDC’s Excellence in Economic Development awards represent the best of economic development and exemplify the leadership that our profession strives for every day,” says 2021 IEDC Board Chair and Invest Buffalo Niagara, President, and CEO Tom Kucharski. “We’re incredibly honored to recognize the outstanding organizations that received this year’s Excellence Awards. This year, more than ever, has presented opportunities to innovate, impact, and progress the cities, neighborhoods, and communities around us. Each of this year’s recipients represents the best of the economic development profession and exemplifies the ingenuity for fellow economic developers to aspire to in the years to come.”
The Queen’s Career Apprenticeship: Kingston program is a privately funded, one-year, salary paid, career apprenticeship that helps new graduates jumpstart their careers and gain experience while helping small business attract and retain highly skilled talent in Kingston. Arts graduates apply to local companies; companies receive four months of funding towards the graduate’s salary and successful applicants have a guaranteed full-time job for at least one year.
“The Gold Rank award is affirmation of the successful partnership between Kingston Economic Development Corporation and Queen’s University Faculty of Arts and Science. Leaders Donna Gillespie, CEO of Kingston Economic Development and Dean Crow focused on innovation and positive outcomes for their respective stakeholders. This award validates the critical importance of both full-time employment upon graduation for new graduates and communities attracting and retaining young talent,” says Alan Rottenberg, Program Founder and Venture Capitalist.
Alan Rottenberg, an Ottawa-based philanthropist and venture capitalist, saw how hard it was for his sons and their friends to find an employer willing to invest in them as recent arts graduates. Rottenberg, an arts grad himself, decided to do something about it by piloting the program in Kingston in 2018. The program has seen great results for the employers that participated as well as the community. Since its inception, the program has launched over 40 careers in Kingston and has generated more than $2.5 million in payroll. Kingston is the first community to host a program like this, though today, eight other Canadian communities are taking notes and working with Rottenberg and his Canadian Career Apprenticeship Initiative.
“I started my career as an apprentice almost three years ago and it has been a tremendous opportunity for me to grow. This program is an incredible way understand the full impact of what arts students have to offer to Kingston employers,” says Nour Mazloum, Communications & Events Officer, Kingston Economic Development Corporation. “We have world-class employers; we have some of the brightest minds graduating from Queen’s. When we can put them together, great things happen in our community.”
“‘Where/how do I get experience if no one is willing to hire me?’ is an all too familiar question,” says Chandra Erickson, Experiential Learning Coordinator, Faculty of Arts and Science. “Most entry-level positions ask for experience creating a common hurdle for new graduates during their initial job search. This program bridges the gap, providing meaningful first work experience(s) and keeping our graduates in Kingston.”
“We hired two excellent candidates over the past few years through the Queen’s Career Apprenticeship: Kingston program. The program allows us to remain connected to the Queen’s University community, while accessing an excellent group of candidates. The pool of candidates provided by program easily represent our strongest cohort of applicants and interviews each year. What we appreciate most about the program is the candidates’ ability to select employers that suit their interests and career paths; encouraging a strong mutual fit from the hire date,” says James Puffer, VP of Operations, Venture Club.
Kingston is the first Canadian city to win in this category and it is the first time that Kingston Economic Development has won an IEDC gold award.

# [Kingston Ranks Top Small City in Canada for Startup Ecosystem - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/kingston-ranks-top-small-city-in-canada-for-startup-ecosystem/)

Kingston, Ontario – May 31, 2022 – StartupBlink released their 2022 global startup ecosystem rankings of 100 countries and 1,000 cities at a virtual conference in London, UK.
For a second year in a row, Kingston ranks 9th in Canada (183rd globally) in the Global Ecosystem Index Report for its startup ecosystem. Notably, Kingston is the leading small city (100,000 – 500,000 population) for its startup ecosystem.
Kingston leads a strong sector-based ranking being 4th in Canada for Healthtech (79th globally), 6th in Canada for Energy & Environment (59th globally) and 7th in Canada for Hardware & IoT industries (85th globally). Kingston also ranks 70th in North America for its startup ecosystem and Canada ranks 4th globally.
“It’s great to see Kingston continue to rank well in the StartupBlink Ecosystem report,” says Mayor Paterson. “This kind of ecosystem doesn’t happen by accident – it requires partnership, collaboration, and strategic initiatives to build an atmosphere that fosters innovation and entrepreneurship – and I’m very proud of the investments made community-wide to achieve this.”
The Global Startup Ecosystem Index by StartupBlink has been updated annually since 2017 and is the world’s most comprehensive startup ecosystem ranking of 1,000 cities and 100 countries ranked by data points in an index ranking. The Global Startup Ecosystem Index is built using hundreds of thousands of data points processed by an algorithm which takes into account several dozens of parameters.
StartupBlink noted that Kingston is an inspiring city that punches over its weight for a small city with a population between 100,000 – 300,000 along with Santa Barbara (USA), Cambridge (UK), Boulder (USA) and Burlington (USA).
“We are honoured once again to see Kingston ranking positively in a global context. Kingston is very positioned for startups to tap into international opportunities and the attraction of global entrepreneurs. Kingston Economic Development with our many ecosystem partners provides tremendous support for startup investment and ensure resources and opportunities are available for Kingston companies to scale globally,” says Donna Gillespie, CEO, Kingston Economic Development Corporation.
StartupBlink acknowledged that there are over 166 startups in Kingston and highlighted Li-Cycle which was founded in 2016 in Kingston, where the city’s ecosystem played an essential role in supporting Li-Cycle’s growth with GreenCentre Canada and Kingston Process Metallurgy from concept to commercialization. Li-Cycle recently announced that they are expanding their operations and opening a Centre of Excellence in Kingston’s new Clogg’s Road Business Park.
StartupBlink also noted Elentra and Kings Distributed Systems. Elentra is a cloud-based teaching aid, scheduling system and assessment tool all-in-one. Elentra was originally developed at Queen’s University and now used all around the world. Elentra empowers academic institutions to train the next generation of health-care professionals to better serve patients and advance medical research.
Kings Distributed Systems is a Kingston-based tech start-up founded in 2017 developing a JavaScript and Web Assembly based distributed compute platform to accelerate Canadian science, innovation and discovery.
“Queen’s University is a catalyst for advancing research, innovation, knowledge mobilization, and entrepreneurship”, says Jim Banting, Assistant Vice-Principal, Partnerships and Innovation. We are pleased to work with numerous partners in our innovation ecosystem to deliver a wide range of programs and services to support entrepreneurs and accelerate the growth of startups and SMEs in our region. Kingston’s ranking in the 2022 Global Ecosystem Index Report recognizes the strength and impact of our ecosystem, and we look forward to continued collaborations that support the health and growth of our regional economy.”

# [Delegates from European and Asian Countries Tour Kingston - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/delegates-from-european-and-asian-countries-tour-kingston/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/delegates-from-european-and-asian-countries-tour-kingston/_

Kingston, Ontario – September 14, 2022 – Kingston Economic Development had the honour to host a diplomatic delegation from 12 European and Asian countries. The visit was part of the Corporation’s initiatives to promote investment attraction and collaboration to support bilateral trade and foreign direct investment in Kingston and the region.
The visit aligns with Kingston’s recent recognition by _Site Selection_ _Magazine_ as one of Canada’s Top 20 Cities to Invest in. The international investment promotion initiatives undertaken by Kingston Economic Development throughout the years positioned the city as top location when it comes to site selection, not only in North America, but also globally.
Companies such as Frulact invested more than $70M in Kingston with a significant expansion in 2021, and Canada Royal Milk invested over $300M in their facility, are proof to the value proposition and support Kingston offers to expanding companies. In March, Li-Cycle announced that it is expanding in Kingston with a Centre of Excellence and most recently Umicore’s announcement of its $1.5B investment in EV battery material will see the first industrial-scale manufacturing plant of its kind in North America in Loyalist Township.
“It was a great privilege to host such esteemed guests representing twelve countries. Kingston is ready and open for business and we look forward to working with businesses looking to expand into Kingston,” says Donna Gillespie, CEO, Kingston Economic Development Corporation.
During their two-day visit, the delegation met with key stakeholders from Kingston’s municipal, academic and industrial sectors, each sharing their experience and aspirations for the city. The delegation had the opportunity to meet with Kingston’s Mayor Paterson who shared his vision for the city’s growth and for it becoming a city of the future. The delegation also experienced firsthand the birthplace and stories behind global industry leaders such as Li-Cycle which had its technology developed and commercialized, and its first battery recycling facility in Kingston, and Octane whose founders are paving the way for personalized medicine and cell and gene therapy in Kingston and exporting it to the world.
“We know that Kingston is a great place for businesses to grow and thrive, and it was great to share Kingston’s successes in this area with countries from around the world,” says Mayor Paterson. “As a forward thinking and innovative city, we want to attract businesses from the region and from around the world and this was a great opportunity to demonstrate all the ways Kingston is a perfect place to for investment.”
The delegation visited Queen’s Cardiopulmonary Unit (QCPU) and learned about the Carbon to metal coating institute which recently received $24M in funding from Canada’s New Frontiers in Research Fund to advance this research. Their novel approach to protecting metal surfaces relies on a molecular primer capable of slowing or preventing oxidation and, degradation of metals.
Feedback from the delegation’s visit to Kingston has been very positive:
“It was an eye-opening visit. The tour serves as a steppings stone for our future collaboration in many important sectors to support Malaysian and Canadian companies grow and prosper in both regions” says Her Excellency Anizan Siti Hajjar Adnin, the High Commissioner of Malaysia to Canada.
 **_“_**With Umicore’s recent announcement to invest in the Kingston area, Belgian’s economic footprint will be expanding significantly. We look forward to exploring ways to further promote bilateral trade and investment in the area.” says Maxime Ramon, Counselor, Embassy of Belgium in Canada.
“It was a very interesting event and definitely was an eye-opener to the opportunities Kingston offers to existing or new businesses,” says Goetz Milcke, Vice President Finance and Administration, Canadian German Chamber of Industry and Commerce Inc.
“Now we are more familiar with Kingston’s initiatives to promote investment internationally as well as some examples of successful projects in sustainable manufacturing and health innovation sectors” says a representative from Consulate General of Japan in Toronto.
Kingston remains a gateway for global companies seeking successful expansion in Canada and North America. To learn more about investing in Kingston visit – [investkingston.ca](http://www.investkingston.ca/)

# [Voltari Installs First Electric Boat Supercharger in Canada - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/voltari-installs-first-electric-boat-supercharger-in-canada/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/voltari-installs-first-electric-boat-supercharger-in-canada/_

Kingston, Ontario – September 22, 2022 – Kingston’s Mayor as well as representatives of the Kingston Economic Development Corporation and Canadian manufacturer of marine EV systems Voltari Electric, were on hand to welcome the installation of a Voltari “e-Pump” in the Confederation Basin Marina.
This moment marks an important step towards the electrification of pleasure boating, which is a major source of greenhouse gases, as well as air, noise and water pollution.
The e-Pump supercharger, which uses a CCS J1772 plug familiar to drivers of electric cars, delivers a 160Kw charge, making it the fastest marine EV charger in North America at this time.  Also on hand as the e-Pump’s first customer was Voltari Electric’s First Edition, North America’s first electric performance boat to reach the world market.  The e-Pump can take the First Edition’s burly full-day’s-use battery pack from empty to full in one hour, at a cost under $20.
Voltari plans to issue an integrated app which will allow boaters to check availability and reserve a slot at the charger ahead of time.  “No more lining up for the fuel pumps at the marina,” says Voltari CEO Cam Heaps. “No more fuel spills and oil leaks fouling the waterways.  No more smoke and loud engines – just the sound of the water on the hull.  You can have a normal conversation with the person next to you while running this boat.  This technology takes away so many bad things and just leaves all the best parts of being a recreational boater.”
In addition to the e-Pump, Voltari will also be offering residential and portable charging systems compatible with most marinas, in 48 and 80-amp systems, as well as the matching adaptors.  Early standardization in charging interfaces will let them support other electric craft as well as Voltari’s line of performance boats.
Kingston was “a natural choice” for the first Voltari e-Pump, says Voltari President Tim Markou.  “It’s close to our production facility in Merrickville.  We plan to be one of the pump’s regular customers – Kingston’s historic downtown waterfront is a beautiful place to bring customers for test drives.”
Kingston’s Mayor Bryan Paterson agrees, given Kingston’s status as the first city in Ontario to declare a climate emergency, and its proactive stance on reducing environmental impact. “As a City, we’re committed to demonstrating leadership on climate action. That’s why we’re excited to install Canada’s very first EV-boat charging station and to welcome the launch of the country’s first commercially available electric boat,” says Mayor Bryan Paterson. “We’re a boating community and I look forward to making sure Kingston leads the way promoting environmentally friendly boating practices!”
Shelley Hirstwood, Director of Business Development at Kingston Economic Development Corporation, sees the installation and the cooperative relationship it represents as one more asset in Kingston’s leadership position in EV and sustainable technologies. “Kingston is actively engaged in the battery and EV sector supporting investment attraction and business growth activities. Voltari is a great example of a cutting-edge company that values sustainability and a green future,” says Shelley Hirstwood.
Looking out over the water and the boats bobbing in the marina, Voltari CEO Cam Heaps pats the shining surface of the charger and smiles.  “We’ve imagined electric technologies transforming boating and waterways worldwide.  It was an idea before, but now it’s reality.”

## Quality of Life
Kingston is the largest city outside of Ottawa in Eastern Ontario. Boasting one of the most entrepreneurial workforces in Canada, we are continually encouraged to innovate and grow thanks to the City’s progressive initiatives. The City Council’s focus on sustainability, innovation, and climate change also demands this community growth.
In addition to the many economic and developmental opportunities available in Kingston, we also provide a world-class quality of life. Kingston is known as one of the best places to live in Canada. Kingston has a thriving downtown district, with a vibrant art and theatre scene, and a high-class, yet eclectic, restaurant and bar district.

A city brimming with culture, Kingston has the most museums per capita and plenty of lively summer festivals. Its waterfront bike trail and the Gord Downie Memorial Pier offer residents and visitors plenty of spots to unwind. Kingston also runs a local summer farmer’s market (and a year-round indoor market), with summertime events along bustling Ontario Street.
Traffic is minimal, which means that getting anywhere in the city usually takes about 15 minutes. Green spaces, like regional conservation areas, Ontario Parks, and National Parks are also a short drive from the city.

# [MetalCraft Marine nominated for Most Significant Boat of the Year by Workboat Magazine. - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/metalcraft-marine-nominated-for-most-significant-boat-of-the-year-by-workboat-magazine/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/metalcraft-marine-nominated-for-most-significant-boat-of-the-year-by-workboat-magazine/_

November 14, 2022 – MetalCraft Marine (MCM) has been nominated for a prestigious industry award, the Most Significant Boat of the Year from Workboat Magazine.
MCM designed and manufactured the FireCat 25M, christened the Monjeb 2, for Kuwait Fire Services. 
Starting in 2015 with a concept originated by the Director of Fire Services, MCM dedicated thousands of hours designing the fireboat systems to be flawless, easily operated and serviced.
Designed and manufactured between the MCM sites in Watertown, NY and Kingston, ON, the result is a 182,500lb catamaran with two extra wide hulls that are big enough to house large diesels and lots of firefighting equipment and offer greater stability on rough waters. The bridge is gigantic with a full width wraparound console that houses a full electronic control display that operates six fire monitors, pumps, and hydraulic towers. A very unusual electronic feature of the boat is the Radio Direction Finder, which is the only RDF that gives the latitude and longitude of the radio signal.
A specific requirement of the build are its towers that had to be tall enough to reach the decks of huge oil carriers that travel through Kuwait Ports exporting approx. 2,000,000 barrels of oil every day. The Monjeb 2 is a NFPA (National Fire Protection Agency) Class I and II fireboat and through its innovative design, at 27 knots it is twice as fast as other NFPA fireboats and half the cost to build.
“This boat is the first of its kind, it has never been done before,” says Bob Clark, MCM Contracts Manager. “We’re proud of our entire team of skilled professionals and the suppliers who contributed to this next generation fireboat. We’re thrilled to be nominated for the Most Significant Boat of the Year. It feels good to have everyone’s hard work recognized for this innovative project.”
Every year Workboat magazine nominates ten significant boats based on a variety of criteria including original concept builds, innovative design, and advancing new workboat frontiers like wind energy. Industry peers and the readers of Workboat Magazine are invited to vote for their favourite vessel. The winner is determined by popular vote and will be announced at the International Workboat Show in New Orleans at the end of November. In 2020 MCM won the award for their Interceptor patrol boat that was built for the Los Angeles Port Police.

# [New Partnership Will Benefit Canadian Farms While Capturing Carbon at Scale - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/new-partnership-will-benefit-canadian-farms-while-capturing-carbon-at-scale/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/new-partnership-will-benefit-canadian-farms-while-capturing-carbon-at-scale/_

Kingston, Ontario, 19 October 2023 – Canadian Wollastonite is set to play a pivotal role in one of the world’s largest enhanced rock weathering (ERW) carbon removal projects thanks to a new partnership with UK- based company UNDO Carbon. By spreading multi-purpose mineral wollastonite on agricultural land, this partnership enables the generation of high-quality, permanent carbon credits while improving crops, soils, and bottom lines for Canadian farmers. Canadian Wollastonite has set an initial goal to remove one million tons of carbon dioxide (CO₂) in the coming years.
ERW is a nature-based carbon removal technique that permanently locks away CO₂ from the atmosphere. Rock weathering has been happening naturally for millions of years, but ERW greatly accelerates the carbon capture process by grinding silicate rocks like wollastonite down to a fine powder and applying it to agricultural land. The increased surface area reacts rapidly with CO₂-infused rainwater, breaking down the rock. The weathered rock releases beneficial nutrients and bicarbonates, which eventually end up in the oceans as solid carbonate minerals, permanently removing CO₂.
“We look forward to a fruitful partnership with UNDO and highly encourage farmers in eastern Canada to get in touch with us and take advantage of this great benefit model.” says Bob Vasily, President of Canadian Wollastonite.
**Wollastonite – Rapid CO****2** **Removal Through Enhanced Rock Weathering**
In operation since 2013, Canadian Wollastonite has been at the forefront of researching wollastonite’s advantages as a soil amendment, its co-benefits on agricultural land, and its carbon capture potential via ERW for the better part of a decade.
Working together, UNDO and Canadian Wollastonite supply crushed wollastonite to farmers at a significant discount. Through ERW, wollastonite traps and permanently locks away CO₂ from the atmosphere. For every 1.6 metric tons of crushed wollastonite spread, 1 metric ton of CO₂ is captured. Wollastonite also boasts a wealth of benefits for farmers and our food supply. As the rock weathers, it releases calcium, magnesium, and silicon, as well as other major and minor nutrients into the soil. The result is greater yields, increased pest resistance, and improvement to the pH of soils. Wollastonite can be spread on any field and replaces lime, a common soil additive that emits CO₂. Spreading wollastonite empowers farmers to fight climate change while positively impacting their livelihoods for years to come. Canadian Wollastonite currently has 17 million tons of wollastonite readily available, making it a reliable and sustainable supplier for agriculture, and other industries seeking effective and measurable solutions for reducing carbon output.
**A Natural Carbon Removal Partnership**
While Canadian Wollastonite supplies farms with crushed wollastonite, which captures CO₂ and improves soils, UNDO’s ERW expertise brings extensive technical knowledge to precisely measure and verify the CO₂ being captured. UNDO has spread more than 150,000 tons of silicate rock since its founding in 2022, and this partnership enables the ERW-focused carbon removal company to scale its international operations.
“We are thrilled to be working with Canadian Wollastonite,” says Rob Palmer, head of Emerging Technology at UNDO. “It’s exciting to see wollastonite’s advantages as a carbon removal solution and a benefit to farmers across Canada.”
With closely aligned values and a shared desire to deploy nature’s resources to pioneer radical climate action, Canadian Wollastonite and UNDO’s partnership is tailor-made for success. Canadian Wollastonite is among North America’s most environmentally responsible mining companies and has planted more than 15,000 trees on its Kingston property. It has developed several large wetlands, noting a marked increase in purple martin, duck, and bat populations. Less than 15% of the property’s 220 hectares of land will be disturbed by mining activities, allowing environmental projects to enrich the
surrounding area. Furthermore, Canadian Wollastonite plans to install solar panels in 2024 in an effort to expand the use of renewable energy powering its operations.
Even at this early stage, UNDO’s lifecycle operations with Canadian Wollastonite boasts more than 90% carbon efficiency. This means that for every 100 tons of CO₂ removed through the spreading of wollastonite, less than 10 tons of CO₂ are emitted in the process of mining, crushing and milling.
**Plans to Scale Operations**
By the end of 2023, Canadian Wollastonite plans to spread 10,000 tons of Wollastonite on farms in Ontario on behalf of UNDO, expanding to 100,000 tons in 2024. Canadian Wollastonite encourages farmers and landowners in Ontario and Quebec to get in touch and find out how they can receive wollastonite for the benefit of their soil, crops, and the planet.
Canadian Wollastonite and UNDO’s partnership is truly a win-win scenario: a win for local farmers and businesses engaged in using wollastonite, and an environmental win as the world continues the battle to stabilize and reduce the amount of Carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere.

# [Conditioned for Success - Dr. Aba Bowles-Mortley - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/conditioned-for-success-dr-aba-bowles-mortley/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/conditioned-for-success-dr-aba-bowles-mortley/_

Dr. Aba Bowles-Mortley’s entrepreneurial journey started with those simple but dangerous words, “let’s see how it goes.”
In 1985, Aba’s mother, Cheryl, gave up her executive job at Nestlé and put her chemistry knowledge to work creating a line of cosmetics in her home country of Trinidad and Tobago. The line would be named, Cher-Mère.
In 1998, Aba moved to Kingston to complete an undergraduate degree at Queen’s University. She later completed both a master’s degree and a PhD in materials and chemical engineering at Royal Military College.
After her studies were complete, and a brief teaching stint, Aba decided to bring the family business to Kingston and to Canada.
“I am proud of the products, which work well and have been successful for more than 35 years in Trinidad,” she said. “I didn’t want Cher-Mère to end with me and a few friends encouraged me to take it on and so here we are, seven years later.”
Shortly after graduating, Aba opened the first Kingston spa location for Cher-Mère Canada and began selling cosmetics. She added another Kingston location in 2018.
Aba is also the Assistant General Manager for her mother’s company, supporting the five Cher-Mère spas back in Trinidad and regularly seeks new opportunities to expand Cher-Mère internationally.
“We plan to start selling our cosmetic products online and we are investigating opening spas in other Caribbean and African countries,” she said.
“We are also looking at manufacturing the cosmetics here to meet demand and possibly opening new stores, kiosks, or spas elsewhere in Canada.”
Underpinning Aba’s success is her community-focused approach. She enjoys meeting people through her business and wants clients to feel like they have a relationship with Cher-Mère and its employees.
Leading her own business has afforded her several leadership opportunities within the community, such as the chair role on the Tourism Kingston Board of Directors and a co-chair spot on the Queen’s University Council on Anti-Racism and Equity. She has also volunteered at Youth Diversion for the past 20 years.
“I think that it is important to be an active member in the community,” Aba said. “I think that every individual can be responsible for making changes within their communities through activism whether it be by volunteering your time or serving on boards to help make decisions that have a greater impact on the community as a whole.”
Aba values the opportunity to give back to the community through her spas. Cher-Mère has fundraised for the Heart and Stroke Foundation, Youth Diversion and for causes such as breast cancer awareness.
These volunteer and philanthropic activities, coupled with Aba’s people-centric approach, helped her develop the network that supported her success in Kingston.
“I grew a base of people who knew who I was before I started,” she said. “There has to be some backing behind your great idea to help you validate that this is the right business. And, as every immigrant does, you need to work hard at it!”
When she’s not in the spa, on a business call with her mother, volunteering, or at a board meeting, Aba spends time with her four children and her husband, who is also an entrepreneur.
“I’d like to be here for many years and continue my family business, if my kids choose to do so,” she said. “I continue to seek new opportunities to learn, meet new people and support important causes in Kingston and beyond.”

# [Funding Available for New Arts Graduates to Launch First Careers - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/funding-available-for-new-arts-graduates-to-launch-first-careers/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/funding-available-for-new-arts-graduates-to-launch-first-careers/_

Kingston, Ontario – November 14, 2022 – Kingston Economic Development is pleased announce that applications are now being accepted from Kingston businesses for the 2023 Queen’s Career Apprenticeship: Kingston program. Up to $10,000 for Kingston employers in funding is available to support 15 positions for new graduates from the arts, humanities and social science disciplines within the Faculty of Arts and Science at Queen’s University. The objective is to help new graduates launch their careers while retaining skilled talent in the community. Employers who commit to a 12-month contract are reimbursed for four months of the gross salary to a maximum of $2,500 per month.
The Queen’s Career Apprenticeship Program was piloted in Kingston in 2018, Since its inception, the program has launched over 45 new careers in Kingston and has generated more than $2.5 million in payroll from an initial investment of $400,000.
“The Queen’s Career Apprenticeship: Kingston program provides graduates with a great introduction to the workforce and young professional lifestyle in Kingston. For employers, the program links them directly with a new hiring channel that taps into some of the amazing talent graduating with a Queen’s Arts & Science degree. As workforce challenges continue to persist in our region, this program is an absolute win for both sides,” says Rob Tamblyn, Business Development Manager – Small & Medium Enterprises.
The program’s initial success in Kingston led to a model, now under the umbrella of the Canadian Career Apprenticeship Initiative (CCAI) that has expanded into six other Canadian communities including Hamilton, London, Guelph and Okanagan.
“CCAI congratulates Queen’s University and Kingston Economic Development Corporation on launching the sixth year of the Queen’s Career Apprenticeship: Kingston program. There are now six universities and their home cities who have followed Kingston’s lead in enabling arts graduates secure meaningful careers with local employers immediately upon graduation,” says Alan Rottenberg, Founder of CCAI.
CCAI partners with leading universities and local economic development organizations to match new arts and humanities graduates with local employers to launch their first careers. The model is unique in that the program was driven by private sector founder Alan Rottenberg’s vision for a better way to connect graduating young talent with non science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) degrees with employers in medium sized cities. Participating communities benefit from retaining motivated, competent and capable university graduates who might otherwise depart for bigger cities in search of work.
“The Queen’s Career Apprenticeship: Kingston program and its team were invaluable in connecting our clinic with motivated, hard working young graduates who we would otherwise have been unlikely to find through our usual hiring streams. These new team members have brought fresh ideas and enthusiasm to our office. They are quick and eager learners and the program’s subsidy has allowed us to devote the proper time to training them in their new roles. I would highly recommend this program to any employer that feels they would both benefit from the fresh perspective a new graduate can bring and are able to offer the time and mentoring that a new graduate requires,” says Alexander Legnini, Director, Kingston Institute of Psychotherapy & Neurofeedback.
In 2021, the Queen’s Career Apprenticeship: Kingston program won a Gold Rank from the International Economic Developers Council (IEDC) for launching the program in Kingston. In 2022, the Humanities Career Apprenticeship Program in Hamilton was honoured with a Silver Rank award for their post secondary collaboration.
“The apprenticeship program has a direct impact connecting businesses with young, skilled talent. The program provides employers with funding to support on the job training and transitioning new graduates into careers. We appreciate the ongoing investment from the Canadian Career Apprenticeship Initiative and Queen’s University to support Kingston businesses in 2023 and advance our retention strategies for young professionals in Kingston,” says Donna Gillespie, CEO of Kingston Economic Development Corporation.
Employer deadline for applications is February 10, 2023.

# [Empowering Teachers to Change Lives - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/empowering-teachers-to-change-lives/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/empowering-teachers-to-change-lives/_

Nigerian entrepreneur, Hakeem Subair had to travel halfway around the world to find a way to help sub-Saharan Africa solve its education problem. He found his solution in Kingston.
With the help of supporters there, his One Million Teachers (1MT) social enterprise has created an innovative, grassroots program that pays impoverished teachers to improve their teaching skills.
“Kingston has adopted us,” he says, citing assistance from Queen’s University, St. Lawrence College, Kingston Economic Development Corporation and the local education community. “When it comes to making the world a better place, Kingston punches far above its weight.”
So far, 1MT has reached 17,000 African teachers since Hakeem developed the concept in 2017 at an annual city brainstorming event that works to solve global issues. Using a website and apps, 1MT now offers modest cash rewards to participating teachers as they progress through its training levels.
Education is the key to fighting high child mortality and youth unemployment in Africa, he says. “And teachers are the world’s most important resource. They make things happen.”
Convinced that government agencies take too long to formulate a response to education problems, Hakeem and his team have found ways to upgrade teaching skills by dealing with individual teachers directly. So far, they have created 415 community learning hubs in 16 countries that bring teachers, mentors and students together with or without classrooms. The countries include Nigeria, Rwanda, Kenya and Ghana.
Both Queen’s and St. Lawrence College send volunteers to 1MT’s suburban headquarters to provide help on social media, marketing and programming projects. In addition, small teams of Queen’s education students earn academic credits working with the learning hubs. Experienced teachers 
host online master classes and mentor 1MT participants.
A COVID-inspired shift to online teaching brought new attention to some of 1MT’s ed-tech content for the Canadian school system, adding additional revenue with the help of government relief programs.
1MT’s latest program is a 2022 four-city photography exhibition (Kingston, New York, London and Stockholm) that highlights its promotion of the United Nation’s sustainable development goal (SDG) of improved education for children. The exhibit focuses on 1MT’s education-through-art program in Nigeria.

## Talent
One of Kingston’s greatest assets is its talent. Kingston is the leading city outside of Ottawa in Eastern Ontario and has an active regional workforce of over 200,000 people and three post-secondary institutions that attract 30,000 students each year. The talent ranges from an experienced and dedicated labour to top global expertise.
Kingston provides access to Canada’s most educated workforce, with two-thirds of its population having completed some post-secondary education. Kingston is also home to three post-secondary institutions: Queen’s University, St. Lawrence College, and the Royal Military College of Canada. With major research hubs and progressive programs at each, these institutions foster a symbiotic relationship that funnels innovation into the community, into the private sector, nationally amongst Canada’s major research hubs, and globally into the competitive market.
In particular, Kingston has the largest number of chemical processing experts per capita in Canada and has significant talent in metallurgy.
Canada offers highly competitive immigration policies so that your company can access that global talent pool in a streamlined and expedited process. Through the Global Talent Stream, employers receive Labour Market Impact Assessments in 10 business days and work permit in 10 business days. Kingston Economic Development is a referral partner for the Global Skills Stream and Global Talent Stream.

# [Li-Cycle: Leading the Green Economy - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/li-cycle-leading-the-green-economy/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/li-cycle-leading-the-green-economy/_

When the world’s first generation of e-vehicles are towed into scrapyards this decade, an innovative facility in Kingston is ready to recycle their massive lithium-ion batteries — and reclaim thousands of tons of their valuable components.
Li-Cycle (NSE: LICY), a new generation “urban mining company” with more than 20 patents, has just wrapped up a pilot project in the city that proves it can recover 95% of a lithium-ion battery’s useful material, including carbonates (manganese and lithium) and sulphates (nickel and cobalt) and refine it for sale back to the manufacturers of new EV batteries. The investment world recognized its innovation earlier this year with an IPO that gives it a $1.55 billion valuation.
Having demonstrated that it can retrieve valuable resources effectively through a non-polluting, hydrometallurgical/wet chemistry process, Li-Cycle is now sharing those results with potential partners and customers around the world. Its first LI battery waste refinery — the final stage of its two-step recycling process — will be completed in Kingston next year with a capacity to process 120,000 electric-vehicle battery packs annually.
In the meantime, Li-Cycle’s new Kingston plant has capacity to grind up 5,000 tonnes of batteries a year, making it the continent’s largest LI battery recycler. Its mechanical process allows for the recovery of such valuable materials as lithium, nickel, cobalt, copper and aluminum that will be recovered at its new refinery.
The eastern Ontario plant is the first of 20 regional recycling “spokes” located across North America that by 2025 will supply raw material to Li-Cycle’s “hub” refineries in Kingston and three other cities.
Li-Cycle now has three dozen employees at its Kingston research and processing facility. Early work on its operations also involved two other Kingston companies. Kingston Process Metallurgy Inc. assisted Li-Cycle in scaling up from concept to commercialization; Green Centre Canada helped with Li-Cycle’s refining process in its testing labs. And local firm BGM Metalworks is producing modular units for use in Li-Cycle’s new American facilities.
Li-Cycle CEO and co-founder, Ajay Cochar, says, “Kingston will continue to be central to our core business as both an operational asset and a facility where we develop, enhance, and improve our technologies.”

# [Kingston-Based Mesh AI Rapidly Expands Influence in Healthcare Tech - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/kingston-based-mesh-ai-rapidly-expands-influence-in-healthcare-tech/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/kingston-based-mesh-ai-rapidly-expands-influence-in-healthcare-tech/_

April 2024 – Kingston’s own Mesh AI, a rising star in the healthcare technology sector, has marked impressive growth, nearly doubling its revenue every 12 months. The company now supports clinicians across nearly half of the provinces and states in both Canada and the U.S., demonstrating its increasing influence in North America’s healthcare landscape.
Further bolstering its expertise, MESH Scheduling Inc., the parent company, has expanded its venture advisory board to include eight leaders from the clinician and healthcare SaaS (Software as a Service) sectors. This strategic move is aimed at enriching the company’s knowledge base and enhancing its decision-making capabilities in serving a growing market.
At the forefront of innovation, Mesh AI recently celebrated two significant accolades. The company secured first place at the Startup Showcase during the InnovatorMD Global Summit in January 2024, a testament to its pioneering solutions in healthcare technology. Additionally, Mesh AI clinched the top spot in the CharmHealth EMR Innovation Challenge in September 2023, further cementing its reputation as a leader in electronic medical records innovation.
Earlier this year, Mesh AI introduced two major systems/modules specifically designed for the North American PGME (Postgraduate Medical Education) communities at teaching hospitals: the Mesh AI Advanced Request System and the Mesh AI Block Scheduler. These systems have already been successfully implemented and are actively used by healthcare professionals, underscoring Mesh AI’s commitment to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of medical education and healthcare scheduling.
As Mesh AI continues to expand and innovate, it remains a key player in transforming healthcare administration and patient care through advanced technology.

# [Black Entrepreneur Ecosystem for Southeastern Ontario Launch Event - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/black-entrepreneur-ecosystem-for-southeastern-ontario-launch-event/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/black-entrepreneur-ecosystem-for-southeastern-ontario-launch-event/_

Kingston, Ontario – February 24, 2023 – Kingston Economic Development is pleased to support the recently incorporated Black Entrepreneurship Ecosystem for Southeastern Ontario (BEE-SEO). This organization was established with the intent to help identify, guide, and connect Black entrepreneurs in this region with resources and support system that helps accelerate Black-owned businesses growth and the entrepreneurship culture among early stage and potential entrepreneurs.
BEE-SEO operates as a non-profit and employs a strategic approach of partnering with entities at the provincial and federal levels in Southeastern Ontario to aid in program development and service delivery. Black-owned businesses are often considered to be side hustles. A survey conducted in 2021 by the African Canadian Senate Group and Senator Colin Deacon revealed that 44 per cent of Black entrepreneurs in Canada were unable to pay themselves from their businesses. The Black Entrepreneurship Ecosystem for Southeastern Ontario goal is to is to develop and deliver programs to ensure the growth of such businesses, not only as a sustainable source of income for their owners.
An official launch event took place on Thursday, February 23 as part of Black History Month and introduced members of the first BEE-SEO Board of Directors and showcased local entrepreneurs during a pitch panel.  Dignitaries including MP Mark Gerretsen, Kingston & The Islands and Mayor Bryan Paterson were in attendance.
Black entrepreneurs like Anthony Ighomuaye – Founder and CEO of Cavlom; Martha Williams – Founder and CEO at Pedal Works Café and Studio; Emmanuel Tamrat – CEO and Founder at Blindspot Agency; Nomsa Mngoma – CEO and Founder at Dansani Dancing Company, and Constantin Mugenga – Founder and CEO at Imperial Cleaning and Painting company – are some of the local entrepreneurs who showcased their entrepreneurial ventures at the launch event.
“When looking across the Southeastern Ontario corridor, Black-owned businesses are quite scattered and disconnected. So, we saw an opportunity to help bring our growing community together, and this led to a series of meetings that was a catalyst to create a formal organization. We are excited to build sustainable equity and growth for local black entrepreneurs.  We will be conducting a needs assessment to help us understand the key pain points within the community and supports we can offer.  This is an important step forward for Kingston and the region’s business ecosystem,” states Norman Musengimana, entrepreneur, Business Development Manager at Kingston Economic Development, and current BEE-SEO Board Member.
Dejhana Sandes, Programs and Administration Coordinator at Kingston Economic Development adds that “in the Kingston region, the Black community is steadily growing and thriving. We just needed to step forward and organize as a collective rather than individually trying to navigate a path to growth. We are proud to be making these strides and are grateful for the support that we have already been showered with even at this initial stage”.
Patrick Egbunonu, Associate Dean for the School of Business at St. Lawrence College and Dr. Nomsa Mngoma a Clinical Research Scientist and Adjunct Associate Professor round out the rest of the BEE-SEO Board of Directors for the organization and have provided much needed collegiate insight.
To date, the Black Entrepreneur Ecosystem for Southeastern Ontario has been formally incorporated and the organization is well underway with the selection process for additional members to the Board of Directors. One of the initial goals is to develop a comprehensive network of businesses in the region.  All black entrepreneurs and black-led businesses are welcome to join at [bee-seo.ca](https://www.bee-seo.ca/).

# [Summer Company Program Supports Young Entrepreneurs - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/summer-company-program-supports-young-entrepreneurs/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/summer-company-program-supports-young-entrepreneurs/_

Kingston, Ontario – March 14, 2023 – Kingston Economic Development is offering the Summer Company program to students aged 15 to 29 with an opportunity to start and run their own businesses this summer. The program provides successful applicants with up to $3,000 in funding and hands-on business training and mentoring from local business leaders to help turn their entrepreneurial aspirations into a reality. Applications for the Summer Company program are now open until May 15.
“The Summer Company program is a fantastic opportunity for students to gain practical experience in entrepreneurship and build valuable skills that will benefit them in their future careers,” says Meg Hewitt, Summer Company Program Coordinator, Kingston Economic Development. “We are proud to support the next generation of business leaders and help them achieve their goals.”
Throughout the summer, participants will receive coaching and training from experienced business mentors including business bootcamp instructor Claire Bouvier, participate in meetings with local business leaders and complete all program requirements for establishing and operating their business. By the end of the program, they will have gained valuable experience and developed a range of practical skills that will serve them well in their future careers.
“Launching a business can be very exciting and empowering while also being at times overwhelming with the uncertainty that comes with the new experiences. However, doing a program like Summer Company, where you have a whole network of support to help guide you through the process. As a part of the program, there is also a shared energy as you share the journey of launching a business with other entrepreneurs around you,” says Ben Tripp, Founder of HulFlo and Summer Company 2022 Participant. “In the summer of 2022, I launched HulFlo, a system to dry out the inside of watercraft to increase the lifespan of the boat and maintain performance. During the summer I was focused on the development of the product and received mentorship to help improve the marketing of my product. After years of planning, it was extremely rewarding to finally bring the company and product to life. Moving forward, after taking the winter to finish building a new CNC machine, I am excited to soon be officially launching the HulFlo store.”
Kingston Economic Development is hosting a virtual information session on March 21 and an in-person information session on April 11 to support students with the application process as well as any questions they might have.
Interested students are encouraged to apply as soon as possible. For more information on how to apply and to register for the information sessions, visit [investkingston.ca/summercompany](https://www.investkingston.ca/summercompany/)

# [Redefining Engineering Design - Rathi Perumal - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/redefining-engineering-design-rathi-perumal/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/redefining-engineering-design-rathi-perumal/_

Behind every new venture there is a compelling “why,” an animating spirit entrepreneurs bring to every new challenge and opportunity. For Rathi Perumal, founder of Uyir Engineering, the answer lies in the name. Uyir, Tamil for “life,” is what she brings to each project, and what distinguishes her from the pack. It’s a thoughtful, philosophical point of difference, yet fundamentally practical. Contemporary engineering design is people-focused: creating a well-designed space imbued with energy and spirit pays endless dividends for all who use it. Rathi has seized on this concept and made it her business: Uyir Engineering is a life-centric engineering design firm and declaration of her helping-hand worldview.
Rathi, who holds an M.Eng. in Electrical Engineering, formed Uyir in 2020, seeing an opportunity to make a difference in the building construction industry, and willing to do anything it took to achieve success, “I don’t believe in safety nets. I never have,” she says. “It truly meant starting from scratch, from finding clients to learning back-office finance. It also meant sorting out which projects to accept, resulting in times where reluctantly saying “no” took precedence over compromise. Clarifying her firm’s brand and values to the market makes finding and working with clients simpler and more rewarding given their shared outlook, “I have beautiful clients. I love them, and I would do anything for them.”
_We’re specialized in creating open office workspaces that have a modern touch. Our clients are willing to be creative, willing to take that step into the future._
The road less traveled might be the character-forming one with the greatest rewards, but it’s less traveled for a reason. Rathi arrived in Canada from India in 2010, immediately tackling her Masters. After graduating, Rathi worked in the tool and die industry in Detroit, Windsor, Michigan and Tennessee, her career then taking her across south and central Ontario to Leamington, Chatham, London, and Brampton. Some of the less appealing realities of her engineering field began to reveal themselves. Despite abundant opportunities to make it so, the work often wasn’t creative or fulfilling. But it wasn’t until 2017, and arriving in Kingston, that founding her own firm began to take center stage. Family, from her parents back in India to her brother in Philippines, were supportive but worried: Rathi being the first to tackle entrepreneurship. Further increasing the degree of difficulty, engineering is a highly regulated and male-dominated field. Carving out a niche for a life-centric engineering design firm that develops “conscious engineering designs through our intuitiveness, expansive creativity and robust skills” took next-level tenacity. It is therefore little wonder she says, “I am learning important lessons through it all, learning very important things about myself. I believe I’ve grown spiritually through this process.”
Kingston resonates with Rathi, making her feel at home. That happiness and contentment – which she also feels every time she walks into her home – is perfectly balanced by professional opportunities: Kingston is less well-served by the bigger engineering firms, offering an opportunity to provide services without big-city overhead. Her recommendations for newcomers to the city form an astute list: stay true to your values; prioritize mental and physical health; be open to learning; seek community and mentorship; be resilient and patient; and embrace uncertainty.
_I’ve found mentors who make me feel valued. I’ve never met such gracious women: Having a network like this lets me see what I want to grow into._ 
Rathi is making it all work: business is strong and revenue is up. Uyir Engineering is established as “one of Canada’s first women-owned global engineering consulting firms.” A Top 40 under 40 Kingston Young Professional, she has built a people-first company from the ground up based on a clear philosophy and set of values. Her creativity and willingness to find answers make her a well-deserved Startup Newcomer Entrepreneur Award winner, and ideally positioned for long-term growth and success. Rathi Perumal is bringing life back to engineering.

# [Crunching Numbers - Feras Sadek - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/crunching-numbers-meet-feras-sadek/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/crunching-numbers-meet-feras-sadek/_

Feras Sadek never planned on coming to Canada, much less to Kingston. “It’s a bit of a funny story,” he said.
It was 2003 and Feras, who hails from Syria, had a rewarding job as an accountant in the oil and gas sector. He was married with two children and the family had no plans on leaving the country.
One day, a colleague asked Feras to pick up a Canadian visa application from the embassy across the street from where he lived. As Feras returned home, he discovered the clerk had provided him with an additional blank visa application. After a discussion with his wife, he filled it out and sent it in.
A short while later, his family moved to Calgary.
“Ultimately, we moved for better opportunities for our kids,” he said. “Moving was a bit of a challenge, but we settled very quickly, and Calgary became our home.”
As the family got acclimatized to Canada, Feras continued his work in the oil and gas sector. However, along the way, Feras saw an opportunity to create something longer lasting.
“I tried several times to start my own business on the side, and those did not work,” he said. “That was when I was introduced to Orangetheory Fitness. When I saw the Kingston franchise was available, I looked into Kingston and liked what I saw.”
Florida-based Orangetheory Fitness was founded in 2010 and currently boasts over 1,400 studios worldwide, with more than 1,000 studios in North America. Their standard workout is meant to be accessible for anyone with full mobility and it integrates technology to help gym members track their progress.
“Being the first in this market is a bit of a challenge, particularly as Orangetheory Fitness does not have as much brand recognition in eastern Canada,” he said. “However, we are getting along well and hope to open a second location in the east end of Kingston in the coming years.”
Feras credits the helpful and supportive community in Kingston as something that helped his success and sees strong potential for new businesses in the city.
“When you look at this market, you can see the growth that Kingston is experiencing between Queen’s University, the airport renovations, the growth in the east end, the upcoming hospital renovations, and construction everywhere,” he said. “I tell other entrepreneurs and investors to just look at the potential and take advantage of the many opportunities in Kingston right now.”
Switching from accounting to managing a gym is a dramatic career change, but one of the advantages Feras enjoys is it provides more facetime with his customers.
“Every day there are moments where you were able to help a member,” he said. “Small successes make my day.”
Though Feras continues to commute back and forth between Kingston and Calgary, he hopes to settle in Kingston with his family when his children complete university.
“I managed to bring my wife all the way from Syria to Calgary and now I am working on convincing her to move from Calgary to here,” he said with a smile.

# [New Grant Funding Allows Kingston Economic Development Digital Service Squad to Continue to Help Small Businesses Adopt New Online Technologies - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/new-grant-funding-allows-kingston-economic-development-digital-service-squad-to-continue-to-help-small-businesses-adopt-online-technologies/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/new-grant-funding-allows-kingston-economic-development-digital-service-squad-to-continue-to-help-small-businesses-adopt-online-technologies/_

Kingston, Ontario – August 18, 2022 – Kingston Economic Development is pleased to announce that it has received a $280,000 grant from the Digital Main Street program for a two-year Digital Service Squad program, which provides small business owners in Kingston and surrounding area with the tools and support needed to digitally transform their businesses.
“The Digital Main Street program has helped local businesses embrace new digital technologies especially during the pandemic. The program helps to ensure that they have access to support as they respond to change in innovative ways to create new revenue streams and access new markets outside their regular target.” says Rob Tamblyn, Business Development Manager – Small & Medium Enterprises, Kingston Economic Development Corporation.
Digital Service Squads (DSS) are the cornerstone of Digital Main Street (DMS), with trained specialists who meet with brick-and-mortar small businesses, at no cost, to help them complete an online assessment and to introduce them to online training modules designed to build their digital knowledge and skills. This one-on-one DSS assistance includes support for basic website setup, Google Business Profiles, 360⁰ photos, social media presence, and much more. Squad members are also trained to help qualified small businesses with the development of their Digital Transformation Plan and then with the application process for a $2,500 Digital Transformation Grant. Through the Digital Main Street program, Kingston Economic Development Corporation has supported hundreds of businesses since 2018.

## Sell Your Business
Kingston Economic Development’s exclusive business transition services, designed to empower entrepreneurs considering the transition of their business ownership through sale or succession.
At Kingston Economic Development, we understand the challenges that can arise during the succession planning process. We’re here to help you tackle the most common obstacles head-on, ensuring a smooth and efficient transition for your business. Our services addresses key concerns such as:
// Finding a Suitable Buyer: We’ll guide you through the process of identifying potential buyers who align with your business exit strategy.
// Business Valuation: Determining the true value of your business is crucial for a successful transition. Discover how experts assess value, and what methods are right for your industry sector.
// Build the Value of your Business: Many businesses heavily rely on their owners for day-to-day operations. We’ll assist you in implementing strategies to empower your team, streamline processes, and reduce dependency, setting the stage for a seamless transition, and maximum value.
### How to sell a business successfully?
Selling a business can be a complex and daunting task, but with careful planning and execution, it can also be a rewarding endeavor. Whether you’re retiring, pursuing new opportunities, or simply looking to move on, understanding the process of selling a business is crucial.
#### [How to prepare your business for sale?](#1687197612806-9ca79198-d84a)
Before putting your business on the market, it’s important to make it as attractive as possible to potential buyers. Consider the following steps:
// Financial documentation: ensure your financial records are accurate, up-to-date, and well-organized. This includes balance sheets, profit and loss statements, tax returns and any other relevant financial documents. 
// Improve profitability: enhance your business’ profitability by focusing on cost reduction, increasing revenue streams and streamlining operations. Buyers are more likely to pay a premium for a business with a strong bottom line. 
// Clean up your assets: review your physical assets, inventory and equipment. Get rid of any unnecessary items and ensure everything is in good working condition. 
// Legal and contractual obligations: resolve any pending legal or contractual issues, including leases, permits, licenses and contracts. Ensure all necessary agreements are transferable to the new owner.
#### [How to determine the value of your business?](#1687197612813-9e141cc7-f4ab)
Accurately valuing your business is crucial for a successful sale. Consider the following valuation methods:
// Financial statements: review your financial records to assess your business’ profitability, growth potential and future cash flow projections. 
// Comparable sales: research recent sales of similar businesses in your industry to get a sense of their market value. 
// Asset valuation: evaluate the worth of your tangible and intangible assets, including inventory, equipment, intellectual property, customer base and goodwill. 
// Seek professional help: engage the services of a business appraiser or a qualified accountant to obtain an unbiased valuation. Show a strong bottom-line for the last three years, avoid tax minimization or expensing items that should be amortized.  You will reap the benefit on the selling price.
#### [Create a comprehensive marketing strategy](#1687197932177-83fc6b1c-9209)
To attract potential buyers, you need an effective marketing strategy. Consider the following steps:
// Develop marketing materials: prepare a business prospectus or deck, and a confidentiality agreement to share with potential buyers. 
// Identify your target audience: determine the ideal buyer profile based on industry, experience, financial capabilities and synergistic opportunities. 80% of small businesses are sold to someone who already knows the business. 
// Utilize multiple channels: advertise your business on online platforms, industry-specific publications and engage the services of a business broker to expand your reach. 
// Maintain confidentiality: protect your business’s sensitive information by requiring signed confidentiality agreements (NDAs) from potential buyers before sharing detailed information.
#### [Negotiate the sale](#1687198034865-b19f1d8d-e3a7)
Once you have attracted potential buyers, it’s time to negotiate the sale. Consider the following tips:
// Establish realistic expectations: be prepared to negotiate on price, terms and conditions. Remain flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
// Engage professionals: seek the assistance of a business broker, attorney or accountant who specializes in business sales. They can provide guidance, handle negotiations and ensure legal and financial aspects are appropriately addressed. 
// Due diligence: Facilitate the due diligence process by providing all necessary documentation and access to key information about your business. 
// Structure the deal: determine the structure of the sale, whether it’s an asset sale or a share sale and work with professionals to draft the purchase agreement and any other relevant legal documents.

# [A Unique Flavour - Gökhan Cifci - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/a-unique-flavour-gokhan-cifci/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/a-unique-flavour-gokhan-cifci/_

Gökhan Cifci’s journey to Kingston is one of those classic ‘boy meets girl’ stories.
Gökhan started his career in the restaurant industry in his home country of Turkey, but wanted to apply his trade in another setting. Gökhan Cifci’s journey to Kingston is one of those classic ‘boy meets girl’ stories. Gökhan started his career in the restaurant industry in his home country of Turkey, but wanted to apply his trade in another setting. He decided to try a life at sea and worked on cruise ships for several years. That is where he met his wife, Sarah.
As the relationship matured, the couple returned to Turkey so Gökhan could finish his degree in Restaurant, Travel & Tourism. Two years later, they came to Canada to be close to Sarah’s family and to start their own business.
During his first few months after arrival, Gökhan helped his in-laws with their sheep farm in Athens, Ontario. His passion for the restaurant business had not gone away but he was having trouble finding work as he was overqualified for most positions.
After months of searching, he eventually found work and within a few years, he was a bartender at a downtown restaurant called Tango. That ended on one fateful day in 2013.
“Tango shut its doors in January 2013,“ he said. “Sarah and I discussed options and started making business plans. We took over the space in May and spent two months renovating.“
The newly renamed Tango Nuevo re-opened with 13 employees in July of 2013. Gökhan’s time in the local restaurant scene helped him put together a strong team, which included his wife as the Marketing Manager and his sister, Hediye, who migrated from Turkey to join him. Nearly ten years later, nine of the original 13 employees are still with him. He now employs 55 people.
Named one of Open Table’s top romantic restaurants in Canada in 2017, Tango Nuevo, continues to receive glowing reviews. The busy eatery boasts many repeat customers as well as drawing new guests from as far away as Montreal, Ottawa, and Toronto. However for Gökhan, owning Tango Nuevo is more than just producing a good meal.
“The ideas of a fusion tapas restaurant is still a different concept in Kingston, so we train our staff to explain what we are and try to educate our guests,” he said. “It‘s also important to me that we are consistently updating our look. We want to keep the fresh feeling alive for our guests, to have everyone feel like Tango Nuevo is new every time they come in. I feel there are still gaps in the local culinary scene and if we fill those gaps that will help attract more tourists.”
When Gökhan first presented his idea for a tapas bar to the Downtown Kingston Business Improvement Area, they were very supportive of bringing this style of restaurant to a relatively small city like Kingston. He enjoyed strong support from his fellow restauranteurs, something which Gökhan is proud to reciprocate.
“If you look at the mural on my wall, I am advertising every single independent small restaurant downtown,” he says. “I don’t look at other restaurants as competition because we all share the same pie and if we’re all stronger we’ll attract more people.”
Gökhan says in the years to come he and his team will be seeking to grow the company and tap into more opportunities in Kingston’s restaurant tourism sector. We are already seeing expansion, with the opening of Tango Nuevo’s sister restaurant, Mayla Concept, in 2021. Located just two doors down from Tango Nuevo, guests experience sophisticated, fusion cuisine, with a relaxed, upscale feel in their intimate dining room.

# [Umicore Prepares to Construct First-of-its-Kind Battery Materials Production Plant in Canada - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/umicore-prepares-to-construct-first-of-its-kind-battery-materials-production-plant-in-canada/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/umicore-prepares-to-construct-first-of-its-kind-battery-materials-production-plant-in-canada/_

Kingston, Ontario — July 13, 2022 — Umicore plans to make a $1.5 billion investment to build a first of its kind industrial scale cathode and precursor materials manufacturing plant, in eastern Ontario.
This investment would support Ontario’s vision of building an end-to-end electric vehicle (EV) supply chain in the province and becoming a North American hub for building the cars of the future. Building the facility will provide employment for around 1,000 people in the construction phase and employment for several hundred in operations.
Umicore N.V., a multinational circular materials technology company based in Belgium, will build a near-carbon-neutral facility in Loyalist Township to manufacture cathode active materials (CAM) and precursor cathode active materials (pCAM). The components are critical in the production of EV batteries. The investment represents an important step forward on the path towards Ontario’s goal to develop a vertically integrated battery supply chain in the province able to support large-scale EV production in North America.
Cathodes account for about 50 per cent of the value of an EV battery and contain key critical minerals such as nickel, cobalt, manganese, and lithium. This historic investment in eastern Ontario would further connect Northern Ontario’s mineral sector to EV manufacturing in the south. Each component of the battery supply chain plays an important and interconnected role in the production of EVs.
“Today is another perfect example that our plan to rebuild Ontario’s auto industry is gaining speed and will deliver huge wins for communities,” said Premier Doug Ford. “Ontario has everything it needs, up and down our homegrown supply chain, to remain and strengthen its position as a North American auto manufacturing powerhouse. Umicore plans to bring this part of the EV supply chain to Ontario which will continue to transform our auto sector and create good jobs.”
At full production, the plant will produce annual cathode material volumes sufficient to manufacture batteries for one million battery-electric vehicles – almost 20 per cent of all North American EV production at the end of the decade. Umicore’s plant will leverage Ontario’s clean electricity system, that was more than 90 per cent emissions-free in 2021. Ontario is also developing a clean energy credit (CEC) registry that will enable companies like Umicore to voluntarily purchase CECs to demonstrate that all of their electricity has been sourced from non-emitting resources.
The Umicore plant would be the first of its kind industrial scale facility that combines production of precursor cathode active materials (pCAM) and cathode active materials at the same facility. Spanning about 350 acres, construction is targeted to begin in 2023 with operations planned for the end of 2025.
“This important investment by Umicore will turn Ontario into a North American leader in this high-value segment of the EV supply chain and further connect Northern Ontario’s mineral sector to EV manufacturing in the south,” said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. “With recent success attracting major investments to the province, our government is staking Ontario’s claim to developing and building the batteries that will power vehicles of the future.”
This investment in eastern Ontario accelerates the province’s 10-year vision for the Driving Prosperity ― The Future of Ontario’s Automotive Sector plan. Phase 2 of Driving Prosperity, announced in November 2021, demonstrates the government’s ongoing commitment to transforming the province’s automotive supply chain to build the cars of the future, including the production of hybrid and fully battery electric vehicles, EV battery and component production, and increasing exports of Ontario-made auto parts and innovations.
This project is also strategically aligned with the government’s Critical Minerals Strategy announced in March 2022. This strategy will strengthen Ontario’s supply chains, attract new investment in the mining and manufacturing sectors, and build economic development opportunities for Indigenous partners.
“Canada and Ontario have all it takes for Umicore to establish a full-fledged, sustainable supply chain for battery materials, all the way from the mine right to the end-market of electric vehicles. Once the key customer contracts are in place, this expansion in North America would complete our global rollout of regional supply chains for our automotive and battery cell customers to now three continents,” said Mathias Miedreich, CEO of Umicore. “Moreover, we are most grateful to the Canadian and Ontario governments for their support and for their readiness to co-fund this planned project. The facility will help Canada and Umicore in their shared objective of achieving a carbon-neutral battery supply chain.”
Since 2020, Ontario has attracted nearly $14 billion in transformative automotive manufacturing investments, with upgrades and new technology for facilities across the province. This includes more than $11 billion in electric vehicle (EV) and EV battery investments.

Overall, Kingston secured an impressive position ranking 9th of all Canada cities and moving three points up globally to rank 180th in the prestigious Global Ecosystem Index Report.

“Continuing to rank as the top small city in Canada, Kingston is showing its leadership status once again on the StartupBlink Ecosystem report,” says Mayor Paterson. “To see us excel in the Energy and Environment sector demonstrates that we can lead the charge for change through innovation and entrepreneurship. I’m very proud of the community-wide efforts to partner, collaborate and support one another to show Canada and the world what Kingston is capable of.”
StartupBlink’s Global Startup Ecosystem Index, an annual publication since 2017, represents the most comprehensive ranking of 1,000 cities and 100 countries, meticulously evaluated through an index ranking system based on a multitude of data points. The index is curated, incorporating hundreds of thousands of data points processed by an algorithm that accounts for numerous parameters.

Together, we provide unparalleled support to our entrepreneurs and startup founders, fostering continuous improvement in our global ranking and overall performance.

StartupBlink emphasized the presence of over 150 startups within Kingston, spotlighting success stories such as Li-Cycle. Founded in 2016, Li-Cycle’s growth was significantly bolstered by Kingston’s supportive ecosystem, alongside GreenCentre Canada and Kingston Process Metallurgy.  Additional recognition was given to Distributive, a Kingston-based tech startup founded in 2017, specializing in developing a distributed compute platform utilizing JavaScript and Web Assembly.

# [Distributive Tackles Medical Backlog - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/distributive-tackles-medical-backlog/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/distributive-tackles-medical-backlog/_

September 2022 – Distributive, Kingston’s innovative computing company, has recently moved into the world of health innovation with revolutionary surgical scheduling software designed to shorten operating room wait times.
Distributive (originally known as King’s Distributed Systems) was already helping Canadian hospitals to replace expensive cloud-based processing services with their own in-house computer networks when it decided to tackle the medical world’s backlog problem.
Even before COVID-19 disruptions, long waits for surgery were grabbing headlines around the world as hospitals struggled to improve the efficiency of their surgical units. But it was a hospital’s desire for innovation in 2020 that inspired Distributive to search for a high-tech solution. CEO Dan Desjardins put a team of programmers and mathematicians to work creating algorithms that would speed up the complex process of matching surgical time blocks filled with patients and surgeons to hospital resources.
“We believe that simply increasing surgical efficiencies through better block scheduling and coordination can significantly reduce the surgical backlog and get people the surgeries they’ve been waiting for,” says Connor Crowe, Distributive’s business development lead.
Distributive’s new Osler OR software uses advanced predictive analytics to analyze a hospital’s historical data, resources and predicted surgical demands in order to create optimal block schedules. Traditionally, administrators spend months untangling the thousands of variables that are required to create a “block” of surgical time, but now their personal intuition and experience are combined with hundreds of other data points that are optimized by the software.
Since the first version of Osler OR was completed 18 months ago, eight Ontario hospitals in five different healthcare systems have been evaluating the software in trials based on their own needs and resources. So far staff of three of those provincial health authorities have been trained on the system and are getting ready to implement it for planning their next surgical scheduling periods.
To date, those hospitals’ simulations suggest that individual surgeries could be increased by four to eight percent. That potential is particularly significant at a time when COVID-related delays in Ontario hospitals have created a backlog of one million surgeries. An improvement of 8% would represent 80,000 additional operations using existing resources.
Even as Osler OR is being implemented by its first health partners, more hospitals are being recruited as trial participants through the CANHealth Network. In addition, the software is currently being evaluated by the Ontario Bioscience Innovation Organization for inclusion in its early adopter health program that funds innovation in provincial hospitals.
Distributive is already working on a second version of its software — Osler DI —to tackle scheduling for diagnostic imaging departments.
Osler OR is named after Canadian-born Sir William Osler (1849-1919) who is considered the father of modern medicine. Trained at McGill’s school of medicine, he became Johns Hopkins Hospital’s first physician-in-chief and a founder of its renowned Baltimore medical school in 1889.

# [Building a Legacy - Ruslan Yakoviychuk - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/success-stories-ruslan-yakoviychuk/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/success-stories-ruslan-yakoviychuk/_

When Ruslan Yakoviychuk moved to Canada in 2005, it was a homecoming of sorts.
During his working years, Ruslan’s great-grandfather left Ukraine for greener pastures in Canada, eventually returning to Ukraine twenty years later with enough money to buy land and build a school.
His prosperity was short lived when the Soviet Union took everything from Ruslan’s family and sent many of his relatives to work camps. While the money and their property may have been gone, the stories of Canada lingered on and moving to Canada became a dream for Ruslan.
That dream took a step closer to reality in 1992, when Ruslan met Canada’s then-Governor General, Ray Hnatyshyn, during a state visit. The Governor General, whose family happened to be from the same region as, inspired him to pursue his dream.
Seven years later, Ruslan found himself working as a teacher in Ukraine but struggled with the instability and corruption as it tried to re-establish itself as an independent country. Ruslan applied to leave his country, eventually moving to Portugal.
It was in Portugal that Ruslan learned another of the family trades – carpentry–and met his wife. As it turned out, his wife had family in Kingston. As the European economy started to take a turn for the worse in 2005, Ruslan got a Canadian work visa and the couple left Portugal for Canada with just $500 in their pocket. It was not long before they settled on Kingston as their new home.
“I love the way Kingston is set up with the lakes and the people,” he said. “You fall in love the first time you see it.”
He worked as a carpenter until he was able to incorporate his own company, RY Contractor in 2009. He has since founded a second company, Legacy Fine Homes.
“One of my first big jobs was to build a clinic downtown for a local doctor, who happened to be my neighbour,” he says. “He wanted to open his own clinic but was worried about his student debt. I barely spoke any English at that time, but I quoted for half the amount and half the time of another contractor.”
He remembers getting strange looks and a few laughs, especially when he said he had been in business for just three months. Only six weeks later, that changed.
“I finished the job, all four thousand square feet, two weeks early with just the doctor helping me,” Ruslan said with a grin. “After that, I had so much work I couldn’t keep up. Never judge a book by its cover.”
Ruslan shifted gears and slowed down his business in the years since, to ensure he has the time and flexibility to both manage his business and pursue his passions.
In addition to several multimillion-dollar home construction projects throughout the years, Ruslan is involved in the community through groups like the Kingston Homebuilders’ Association and the Portuguese Cultural Centre of Kingston. Even during the 2019 federal election, when he ran for political office, Ruslan was busy building several homes including his family’s dream home.
Besides his work, political ambitions, and community efforts, Ruslan is raising two school-aged daughters, speaks seven languages, and plays music in his spare time. He plans on releasing his second album, this one in Portuguese, in the coming years. Hard work is central to Ruslan’s life philosophy.
“You have to be honest, positive, do a quality job, and never give up,” he says.

# [Lending a Helping Hand - Yu Jier Kou - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/lending-a-helping-hand-yu-jier-kou/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/lending-a-helping-hand-yu-jier-kou/_

From the moment they arrive, newcomers to Kingston benefit from Yu Jier Kou’s advocacy initiatives. As Kingston Immigration Partnership’s Program Coordinator, a part of Kingston Community Health Centres, Yu Jier is instrumental to the successful growth and development of the city’s newcomer social infrastructure.
Immigration is pivotal to Canada’s growth and success. Decades of immigration-friendly initiatives have led to a deserved international reputation as a welcoming and open nation for newcomers. It is a reputation dependent on results, leading to a constant and growing need to provide thoughtful, practical social and economic support. This is doubly true at the local level, where growth-focused cities like Kingston position themselves as destinations for newcomers hailing from a wide variety of backgrounds. Welcoming newcomers and helping them become established is rewarding yet complicated work, requiring dedicated and empathetic professionals like Yu Jier to make the transition to Canadian life as smooth as possible.
Yu Jier’s dedication to fostering community and promoting inclusion is genuinely remarkable. She’s an organizer of the Newcomer Entrepreneurship Awards, a Kingston Literacy & Skills Board member, and active member of the Chinese Canadian Association of Kingston and District. Rather than offer advice to newcomers she says, “I would rather spend that time hearing about _their_ experiences. Everyone’s coming from such a diverse background and experiencing such diverse challenges and successes that I would be curious to learn more.” 
“Integration really is a 2-way street. When newcomers come to Canada they naturally have to adapt, they naturally have to change. They might have to learn a new language, learn a new culture; join a new community,” says Yu Jier. “We also need to become more welcoming for folks, recognizing, on the part of the community, our need for change.” Language is a prime example, given steady growth in Arabic, Mandarin, and Spanish speakers. “Language challenges are big, and really impact newcomers’ access to different community services: going for a medical appointment, registering your child for school, or accessing any sort of municipal services.” Service providers offering expanded language support can reduce newcomers’ sense of dislocation and disconnection, while fostering a sense of community and welcome.
Yu Jier’s work also addresses a practical need: accessing services is simpler when the level of inter-service coordination is higher. Simplifying newcomers’ acclimatization experience involves strategic coordination and networking among government bodies, community leaders, and other organizations. She mentions the Welcome To Kingston mobile app as an example, which supports newcomers across sixteen languages. The app and other initiatives, like October’s forthcoming Welcome Day, are well worth the effort: expanding and strengthening socioeconomic support for newcomers builds Kingston’s reputation as welcoming and well-prepared. Kingston Community Health Centres, KEYS Employment and Newcomer Services, and Kingston Economic Development Corporation are among the organizations playing a leading role.
Kingston is smartly positioning itself for long term economic growth, while constructing a warm and welcoming social layer thanks to the efforts of people like Yu Jier Kou, “It’s the opportunity to make a lot of change for a lot of people. Whenever you’re able to change the system a little bit for the better, that ripples onto different clients and different folks, different newcomers, and really, all people in Kingston.”

# [A Collaboration Innovation Corridor Reaching Across Borders - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/a-collaboration-innovation-corridor-reaching-across-borders/)

Kingston, Ontario – April 4, 2022 – The Kingston-Syracuse Pathway is a cross border partnership that provides companies with innovative and easy solutions to help them grow into the international markets.
Established in 2018, the Kingston-Syracuse Pathway is the fourth cross border collaboration in Canada between business, government, and academic leaders from both sides of the border. The Kingston-Syracuse Pathway will maximize the competitive advantages of Kingston and Northern and Central New York State by facilitating a formal cross-border collaboration on cutting edge research and development, unlocking new global markets for entrepreneurs, startups, SMEs, improving connectivity between governments. The overall vision of the Kingston-Syracuse Pathway is to enhance connectivity and position the region as a leading global innovation ecosystem.
The cities of Kingston and Syracuse are naturally connected in proximity and through shared economic advantages and interests. Kingston, Syracuse, and their surrounding regions are both home to world-class academic and research institutions, innovation ecosystems in key market sectors, including health innovation, biotech, and advanced manufacturing. Both cities enjoy close access to major economic hubs including Toronto, Montreal, and New York City.
Kingston Economic Development, Queen’s University, Kingston Health Sciences Centre, CenterState Corporation for Economic Opportunity, State University of New York Upstate Medical University and Upstate Medical University’s Central New York Biotech Accelerator (CNYBAC) are pleased to announce the signing of a new Memorandum of Understanding to further the partnership and collaboration opportunities.
“By combining our world-class resources, we aim to further advance cross border collaboration and we are excited for this strengthened relationship. The Kingston-Syracuse Pathway will continue to remove barriers for cross-border collaboration for key sectors including health innovation, cleantech and advanced manufacturing,” says Donna Gillespie, CEO, Kingston Economic Development Corporation.
“The relationship between Kingston and Syracuse has continued to strengthen over the past several years. The partnership has included academic medicine and related industries in biotechnology working together as major economic engines for both regions. There have been research partnerships and new entrepreneurial ventures successfully launched. We are very enthusiastic about the continued growth of our relationship,” says Dr. Robert Corona, Chief Executive at State University of New York Upstate Medical University.
The collaboration will help facilitate market entry into the U.S. or Canada for entrepreneurs and innovators through the Soft-Landings Program. It will encourage cross-border strategic partnerships focusing on agreed upon strategic sectors with a focus on health innovation. It will also expand resource-rich education networks and service providers available to innovators.
“We look forward to identifying and pursuing collaborative research opportunities with our colleagues in Syracuse to advance mutual research priorities in health innovation, low carbon, and smart cities, and to supporting economic development initiatives that will bring prosperity to our regions”, says Jim Banting, Assistant Vice-Principal, Partnerships and Innovation, Queen’s University.
“For the last several years KHSC has been working locally to develop our health innovation strategy and this new Kingston-Syracuse Pathway provides a unique opportunity for cross-border teamwork and innovation among academic, health-care and business leaders to benefit care for our patients and families. Throughout the recent pandemic we learned that collaboration & diversity are critical to multiplying the value of our efforts and fast-tracking innovation. We look forward to realizing the closer relationships in our geographic corridor and the economic/innovation prospects this initiative promises,” says Dr. David Pichora, President & CEO, Kingston Health Sciences Centre
With world-class institutions on board from both sides of the border, it will provide opportunities to advance research collaboration in key areas of innovation.
“This collaboration was born out of a university research interest collaborative, The Clayton Summit, and has grown into a responsive partnership to include not only research but also shared education opportunities and innovation interests to advance cross-border technology,” says Kathi Durdon, Executive Director, CNYBAC.
“With our similar size, industries and close proximity, Kingston is a natural partner for Syracuse,” says Robert Simpson, president of CenterState CEO. “We are hopeful that this partnership – with its opportunities to build cross border collaboration in research and development, supplier networks and entrepreneurial ecosystems – can help businesses within Central New York expand to new markets. We look forward to building this relationship further, and the opportunities it will create.”

# [Kingston Rises in Ranks Globally as Top City for Startups - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/kingston-rises-in-ranks-globally-as-top-city-for-startups/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/kingston-rises-in-ranks-globally-as-top-city-for-startups/_

Kingston, Ontario – May 30, 2024 – StartupBlink announced its 2024 Global Startup Ecosystem Index rankings today at a conference in London, UK. StartupBlink is the most comprehensive startup ecosystem mapping and research center and annually ranks 1,000 cities and 100 countries by their startup ecosystem strength.
For five years in a row, Kingston remains the top small city (100,000 – 500,000 population) in Canada for the strength of its startup ecosystem. Kingston ranked 9th overall among Canadian cities and moved up one spot from last year to 179th globally.  Of note, Kingston demonstrated sector strengths in Healthtech (#4 in Canada) and Energy & Environment (#5 in Canada).

Five Canadian cities are present in the top 30 of the world for the Cleantech industry: Kingston ranks 10th, Vancouver ranks 15th, Toronto ranks 17th, Montreal ranks 24th, and Edmonton ranks 30th worldwide.

## ELECTRIC VEHICLE BATTERY DEVELOPMENT
Canada is making significant strides towards the electrification of transportation and becoming a cleantech manufacturing hub. Canada announced that it will ban the sale of fuel-burning new cars and light-duty trucks from 2035 to reach net-zero emissions across the country by 2050.
Kingston’s strategic location is between Canada’s automotive corridor and the raw material supply chain. Kingston is just under a 3-hour drive from Canada’s automotive corridor where major automotive manufacturers such as GM, Ford Motors, and Fiat Chrysler have all committed to building EVs in Canada, makes it a preferred site for companies across the EV supply chain. Whether being a startup seeking technical support and commercialization or a global OEM manufacturer seeking experienced talent, Kingston offers a unique ecosystem that fits well with any business model. Furthermore, Kingston’s proximity to battery raw materials such as cobalt, graphite, lithium, nickel offers a great advantage for companies operating in the global battery supply chain scene.
Canada has been a leader in battery recycling over the past couple of years, with several companies building up recycling capacity to meet growing market demands. Kingston with its thriving sustainable outlook and ample R&D capabilities was the springboard for companies such as Cyclic Materials to commercialize their technologies.
### “The University supplies the talent that you need… jurisdiction side it’s very close to Toronto, to Montreal, Ottawa, 401, train track. Altogether has actually made Kingston a really excellent destination for start-ups.”
## COMPANIES THAT CALL KINGSTON HOME

# [Education for All - Hakeem Subair - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/success-stories-hakeem-subair/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/success-stories-hakeem-subair/_

Hakeem was born and raised in Lagos, Nigeria. He did not set out to be an entrepreneur and never really thought about teaching either. In fact, very few people in his community did. Growing up, he regularly heard that teaching was not a respectable profession because teachers never have money and, therefore, he never considered a career in teaching. He was told that he was a smart kid with a bright future who should not waste his time becoming a teacher. So, after graduating from university, he began a career in banking in Lagos.
All of that changed when Hakeem became a parent. In 2008, Hakeem and his wife, Olajumoke Subair, were looking for an appropriate place to leave their daughter, Nadrah, while they were at work. Subair worked for a bank at the time, and his wife was a busy doctor who was often on call.
They were not satisfied with what they found available to them in terms of schools and day cares where they lived in Nigeria. So, they decided to open their own school.
What started with a handful of friends’ children quickly blossomed into a 192-student enterprise. The school, Tiny Tots Osogbo, was thriving except for one major challenge: finding good quality teachers.
Hakeem and his family moved to Canada in 2012 under the Federal Skilled Worker Program (now called the Express Entry) and later pursued a Master of Entrepreneurship and Innovation degree at Queen’s University, where he also acquired a Certificate in Social Impact from the Centre for Social Impact. This was the time the challenged they faced while running Tiny Tots Osogbo school in Nigeria started informing the creation of 1 Million Teachers (1MT).
Hakeem is passionate about applying business principles to tackle some of the biggest challenges facing our planet. A passion that grew out of providing more than just financing to businesses, but giving them the tools to enhance their success. A passion that led to him becoming the co-founder and CEO of 1MT.
**So what is 1MT?**
1MT aims to close the shortage of quality teachers gap by attracting new teachers into the profession, training both the new and existing teachers, and motivating them to keep improving their performance through a comprehensive reward based development program that combines high quality online and classroom based training with mentorship on a scale never attempted before. The web-based component incorporates gamification best practices that engages participants and motivates them to keep learning. We are leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence to create bespoke training for teachers on a large scale.
1MT has over 10 different partners both in Canada and overseas. In Canada, Queen’s University is their leading partners. But outside Canada, 1MT has partnered with Hewett Packard (HP), Girl Rising, Injini, Azoneta, University of Abidjan, EDVES, TeachUNITED, NECT and many more other partners.
Hakeem says that 1MT is always working to collaborate to find unique solutions to professional development. “For example, On October 15, 2022; Girl Rising, HP, and 1 Million Teachers hosted an official partnership launch event in Abuja, Nigeria to mark the official launch of the program called Mentor-a-Teacher. Under this program, HP employees (mentors) are matched with local teachers participating in 1 Million Teachers’ Black Belt program (mentees) to help mentor teachers to become the best they can.” This is the kind of work that we do and are always happy to make such contribution to our communities.

 _https://www.investkingston.ca/kingston-syracuse-pathway-cross-border-health-innovation-conference/_

Kingston, Ontario – April 26, 2022 – Kingston Economic Development is pleased to be hosting the Kingston-Syracuse Pathway Cross Border Conference focused on health innovation and cutting-edge research from both sides of the border. The conference will take place on June 7, 2022 at the Holiday Inn Kingston-Waterfront (2 Princess Street.)
The Kingston-Syracuse Pathway is the 4th cross-border economic partnership in Canada between business, government, and academic institutions from both sides of the border. Kingston-Syracuse Pathway is the only cross-border partnership focused on the health and life sciences sectors.
The Kingston-Syracuse Pathway Cross Border Conference will launch the renewed economic partnership with a focus on life and health sciences. This will be the first opportunity since the onset of the global pandemic for leading health care and life sciences experts and innovators to come together and dive into how the future of health care is evolving.
“A period of exponential growth in life sciences and the intersections of global economics, technology, and health is more topical now than ever before,” says Ben McIlquham, Health Innovation Manager with Kingston Economic Development Corporation. “The cities of Syracuse and Kingston are both home to world-class academic, research institutions, and innovative ecosystems and are perfectly situated to lead these industries by leveraging this strengthened collaboration.”
The Conference is a full-day event that includes networking, keynote speakers, panel discussions and a pitch competition for startups in the life and health sciences with a $5,000 prize for the top pitch. Discussion topics will focus on vaccines, global health, infectious diseases, research covering Lyme disease, and sharing new ideas and techniques to improve health care.
“The Kingston-Syracuse Pathway is about coordinating collaborative researchers and providing life science start-up companies with expanded connections and soft-landing opportunities both in Syracuse and Kingston. The Conference is an opportunity to highlight health-related research interests, resources, and economic business development projects promoted through these grass-roots cross border programs,” says Kathi Durdon Executive Director at CNY Biotech Accelerator.
Innovator, entrepreneur, teacher, researcher, activist and mentor Allison Turner is the keynote speaker for the Kingston-Syracuse Pathway Conference. She is the Co-Founder and Director of Product Development at PnuVax Incorporated. PnuVax focuses on scale-up and lean biomanufacturing of more affordable products to prevent infectious diseases worldwide. Allison co-founded PnuVax in 2008 and has since been tackling low-cost product solutions for diseases such as yellow fever, Ebola, and MERS, and most recently shifting to COVID-19 products. Allison’s team strives toward a goal of democratizing access to vaccines and therapeutics; PnuVax has developed the only known pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate with a target price of only one dollar per dose. Allison has a MASc in Chemical Engineering from Queen’s University, has held academic research and teaching appointments, and is deeply involved in engaging with local start-up communities.
“We both have valuable educational and health care assets that can support each other, and the business community that relies on them. We also have the potential to support each other’s supplier networks enriching opportunities for our regional firms. And in being only two hours apart, a business from one city which wants to enter an international market can easily interact with their employees and customers on the other side in a single business day,” says David Mankiewicz, CEO, CenterState Corporation for Economic Opportunity.
“Kingston aims to stake a bigger claim on the health innovation space and partnerships like this reinforce our competitive advantage”, says Shelley Hirstwood, Director of Business Development, Kingston Economic Development Corporation.
“The Conference will provide an important opportunity for the partners of the Kingston-Syracuse Pathway initiative to convene, discuss and showcase collaborations to advance cross border research, innovation, and economic development,” says Jim Banting, Assistant Vice-Principal, Partnerships and Innovation, Queen’s University. “We look forward to contributing to the conversation and to facilitating collaborations that will benefit our respective regions, organizations, and institutions.”

This alliance will foster innovation and collaboration by connecting mines, clean-tech and mineral processing technology companies within the value chain, facilitating strategic partnerships and advancing innovation of the supply chain in Ontario.
“Sudbury and Kingston have unique strengths in mining, resource extraction, mineral supply, processing technologies and recycling,” said Greater Sudbury Mayor Paul Lefebvre. “This strategic partnership will help us both advance and capitalize on new opportunities that present themselves during the BEV transition.”

 _https://www.investkingston.ca/queens-career-apprenticeship-kingston-launches-new-cohort/_

Kingston, Ontario – October 31, 2023 – Kingston Economic Development is pleased announce that applications are now being accepted from Kingston and area businesses for the 2024 Queen’s Career Apprenticeship: Kingston program. Up to $10,000 of funding for Kingston employers is available to support 15 positions for new graduates from the arts, humanities and social science disciplines within the Faculty of Arts and Science at Queen’s University. Since its inception the program has helped launch over 50 careers and has generated over $2.7 million in payroll in the Kingston region.
The overall goal of the program is to provide meaningful employment to new graduates as they begin their career journey and to retain the skilled talent graduating from Queen’s University in Kingston. Employers who commit to a 12-month contract and successfully match with a recent graduate are reimbursed for four months of the gross salary to a maximum of $2,500 per month.
“We are extremely proud that this program was “made in Kingston” and has then successfully launched in other communities across the country and into the United States. It speaks volumes to the fact that other communities like ours are wanting to be able to keep the talent that is graduating from colleges and universities in their communities. The Queen’s Career Apprenticeship: Kingston program is a perfect vehicle to assist with that happening,” says Rob Tamblyn, Business Development Manager – Small & Medium Enterprises.
The Canadian Career Apprenticeship Initiative (CCAI) is the organization that oversees the program and provides the funding to communities to launch their chapters. CCAI partners with leading universities and local economic development organizations to match new arts and humanities graduates with local employers. The model is unique in that the program was driven by private sector founder Alan Rottenberg’s vision for a better way to connect graduating young talent with non-science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) degrees with employers in medium sized cities. Participating communities benefit from retaining motivated, competent and capable university who might otherwise depart for bigger cities in search of work.
The 2024 Queen’s Career Apprenticeship: Kingston Launch Event will be held on November 2 at 5:30 to 7:30 at Frontenac Club. [Please RSVP here!](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/737109703967?aff=oddtdtcreator)

# [Caring for Kingston - Aditi Kumar - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/caring-for-kingston-aditi-kumar/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/caring-for-kingston-aditi-kumar/_

Aditi Kumar immigrated to Canada after her wedding and joined her husband in Kingston in 2004. When Aditi arrived, she was unsure what she would do for employment.
To keep busy and meet people as she integrated into Kingston, Aditi volunteered in the physiotherapy department at Providence Manor long-term care home.
“This was my first real connection with the Kingston community,” she said. “The residents and therapy staff at Providence Manor were so kind and appreciative of my time and help. So, I decided to take on physiotherapy as a career and always practiced in geriatrics since.”
Working in the physiotherapy field required a degree. Since she already lived in Kingston, she applied and was accepted into the Master of Science in Physiotherapy program at Queen’s University. She graduated in 2008 and started working in physiotherapy in local care homes shortly after.
Within a few years, Aditi built up her local expertise and connections. While she was on parental leave with her first child, trouble started brewing as provincial funding was reduced for physiotherapy in care homes.
Aditi’s husband had encouraged her to open her own business and the couple decided this was the right time to pursue that dream.
“I decided I would fill this gap in the community that the government had created,” she said.
She incorporated Repute Homecare in 2013.
Within a few short years, the company grew to 25 employees and contractors, and had developed relationships from Napanee to Smiths Falls and to Glenburnie. They currently serve 200 clients a year.
The reviews from satisfied clients are a big boost to her team’s confidence. In their offices, you cannot miss the testimonials and letters of gratitude from clients on the walls. Aditi enjoys working with all clients, but there is a particular segment that she holds near and dear to her heart.
“Every now and then, I get to serve a client that has influenced the community in a huge way,” Aditi said. “Working with such clients and serving them makes me proud.”
She also gets a sense of pride by hiring newcomers, such as internationally trained nurses and helping them integrate into a diverse Kingston community.
When she is not directly working with clients, Aditi is interviewing more professionals to join the team, preparing wheelchair and walker prescriptions and completing paperwork. She is often on the road travelling Repute’s catchment area.
It was not Aditi’s plan to stay in Kingston long-term but once she found work, she realized Kingston was the right place for her and a home for her family.
In 2019, she received another sign that Kingston was the right city for her family: a nomination as Young Entrepreneur of the Year by the Greater Kingston Chamber of Commerce.
“The nomination reassured me that my team is doing the right things and our efforts are valued by the Kingston community,” she said.
She has been especially grateful for the assistance her family received since immigrating.
“Canada is so supportive of immigrants,” she said.
“You welcome us with open arms and support us whether it is as simple as learning the language or building your business. If you have to pick a place to move, Canada should be your first choice. I wouldn’t want to be in any other country.”

# [Building a Community - Tarek Hussein - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/building-a-community-tarek-hussein/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/building-a-community-tarek-hussein/_

Our health means everything. For Tarek Hussein, founder and owner of Weller Pharmacy, everything is about health.
Tarek has worked in pharmacy and pharmaceuticals his entire career, from global pharmaceutical companies to local pharmacies, from undergraduate studies to his Doctor of Pharmacy. So when he says Weller Pharmacy offers the Kingston community the “best personalized pharmaceutical services in a welcoming, inclusive environment,” he knows what he’s talking about.
Weller is a case study in preparation meeting opportunity: with healthcare costs increasing and people’s health needs becoming more personalized, one-size-fits-all, big-box pharmacy stores aren’t the answer. Tarek is positioned right where the market is heading, operating a forward-thinking, ethically focused, community-first independent store designed to meet personal healthcare needs. Having also participated in developing an e-commerce solution that provides independents with the supply-chain scale of national pharmacy chain stores, he is architecting the next generation of pharmacy solutions.
_“We created an online e-commerce platform designed specifically for independent pharmacies, which has been getting much attention lately. If patients are sitting at home and order items, they will be delivered the same day. Even if I don’t carry it on the shelf, we can still fulfil their request within 48 hours.”_
Cairo was once home; now it is Kingston (since 2011). However, in 2006, after finishing his MBA at IE Business School in Spain, an epiphany struck when he realized he was more into entrepreneurial and community-focused work than corporate. It was a catalytic moment, sparking Tarek to direct his business and pharmacy know-how toward improving people’s health his way.
_“When I first arrived in Kingston, I immediately felt connected to the city. The history, waterways, green spaces, and strong sense of community really stood out to me.”_
Weller Pharmacy opened its doors as an independent pharmacy in 2015, an auspicious moment for Tarek. He had the expertise, location, supplier relationships, and community ties. Most importantly, he had the strategy. The gap was evident, including important concepts Tarek strongly advocates, such as “social prescribing,” which recognizes that a range of social, economic, and environmental factors influence health. Referring patients to non-medical services and community resources to improve their overall well-being is more community-maker than money-maker; Tarek sees this as a logical and ethical extension of the pharmacy business.
Tarek highlights that the Kingstonians’ sense of community and inclusion is fundamental. He notes the city’s welcoming nature, describing locals initiating casual conversations with newcomers in places like pharmacies or coffee shops. These interactions often begin with casual conversations, leading to offers of help or invitations to participate in various activities. He emphasizes that newcomers gradually become involved and integrated into the community through these interactions. His own community-oriented approach has led to the Kingston Chamber of Commerce (Chair) and KEYS Job Centre (Vice President and Board of Directors).
_“The community wants you to get involved, participate, and showcase yourself and your business. Kingston allowed me to do what I do, and I am grateful to be recognized for it.”_
Tarek’s success is based not only on know-how but also on community involvement. He has given, and Kingston has given back. His prescription is succinct when asked for advice for newcomers, with both community and newcomer in mind: “Love Kingston and Canada, and they will love you back.”
Congratulations to Tarek Hussein, winner of the Kingston Newcomer Entrepreneur Award.

# [Li-Cycle's Centre of Excellence is Coming to Kingston - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/li-cycles-centre-of-excellence-is-coming-to-kingston/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/li-cycles-centre-of-excellence-is-coming-to-kingston/_

Kingston, Ontario – March 3, 2022 – Kingston, Ontario, Canada is pleased to announce that Li-Cycle, an industry leader in lithium-ion battery resource recovery and the leading lithium-ion battery recycler in North America, is expanding in Kingston with a Centre of Excellence to be established in Kingston’s Clogg’s Road Business Park.
“I’m thrilled that Li-Cycle, a company recognized for its world changing technology, has chosen Kingston as home for their new Centre of Excellence. Li-Cycle is the industry leader in lithium-ion battery resource recovery. This innovative company, with their emphasis on environmental sustainability, is exactly the kind of business we want to see grow in Kingston. That’s why City Council moved to facilitate this development by expediting the new Clogg’s Road Business Park. We’re excited to see this new facility move ahead, and the new jobs and growth that will accompany Li-Cycle’s forward-thinking vision,” says Mayor Paterson.
Founded in 2016, Li-Cycle has developed technologies that can recover up to 95% of all the materials in lithium-ion batteries in an environmentally and economically sustainable manner. Kingston has played an essential role in Li-Cycle’s growth, partnering with Green Centre Canada and Kingston Process Metallurgy to move its patented Spoke & Hub Technologies™ from concept to commercialization. Kingston is home to Li-Cycle’s first commercial Spoke that has a processing capacity of 5,000 tonnes of lithium-ion battery material per year.
“Kingston has played a critical role in Li-Cycle’s success to-date, as it’s where we developed our technologies and opened our first commercial facility,” says Tim Johnston, Li-Cycle’s co-founder and Executive Chairman. “We look forward to our ongoing collaboration with the city as we continue to scale our truly sustainable technologies in dedication to a circular economy.”
“Kingston Economic Development is proud to see the continued growth and investment from Li-Cycle in Kingston. Li-Cycle continues to achieve significant milestones and accomplishments including being listed on the New York Stock Exchange in August 2021. We expect Li-Cycle’s Centre of Excellence to attract new clean tech companies to the region,” praises Donna Gillespie, CEO Kingston Economic Development.
The City of Kingston has expedited the development for Clogg’s Road Business Park to facilitate the growth of Li-Cycle and future clean tech companies. Kingston is dedicated to and has a long history of clean technology that gives the region strong and established roots in this sector. Li-Cycle’s work and investment in Kingston is a great example of the sector capacity.
“Li-Cycle is a global leader in clean technology and the Kingston Centre of Excellence speaks to the opportunity and talent available in the region,” says Shelley Hirstwood, Director of Business Development. “This new opportunity shows the impact of working together as Team Kingston along side our City colleagues.”

## MATERIAL AND PROCESS INNOVATION
Kingston has shown strength in the areas of chemicals (e.g., Green Centre Canada, KPM Accelerate) and primary metals (e.g., Novelis). By applying these technologies to the local manufacturing marketplace, a more sustainable manufacturing ecosystem emerged over the years.
Moreover, Kingston has strong academic research capacity and expertise to leverage in the flagship area of material and process innovation. This capacity includes a national network of university-based micro-macro discovery labs, and the globally recognized Reactor Materials Testing Laboratory. Local innovations in sustainable building materials, advanced polymer composites, graphene, and green chemistry received the required support and built their roots in Kingston.
When it comes to the aluminum industry Kingston has a long-standing history in material innovation, starting with Alcan’s decision to build a sheet rolling plant in Kingston back in 1939, followed by Novelis to set operation in the city. Since then, Kingston has proven itself as a talent hub for secondary aluminum/ recycled scrap. Close to 40 percent of the North American aluminum supply is now created through secondary production, reducing landfill waste, contributing much lower GHG emissions, and reducing international transportation. Kingston has a high location quotient (LQ) in this area (6.38), and can easily supply other markets.

# [Navigating the Mind: Kingston’s Orange Neurosciences Unveils Pioneering Digital Cognitive Skills Assessment - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/navigating-the-mind-kingstons-orange-neurosciences-unveils-pioneering-digital-cognitive-skills-assessment/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/navigating-the-mind-kingstons-orange-neurosciences-unveils-pioneering-digital-cognitive-skills-assessment/_

Orange Neurosciences is on the brink of a groundbreaking advancement in Brain Health (including Mental Health) and education! Kingston-based Orange Neurosciences is thrilled to announce the launch of its state-of-the-art Digital Cognitive Skills Assessment, a revolutionary tool designed to unravel the complexities of the human brain for students and the aging population alike.
A Prestigious Showcase at the G20 Summit in India. The unveiling of this innovative tool follows the company’s proud representation as a leading Canadian Digital Health Company at the prestigious G20 Summit in Bengaluru, India, from August 16-19, 2023. This nomination by the Trade Commissioner Services of Canada in India reflects the pioneering spirit and potential global impact of Orange Neurosciences in the digital health landscape.
A Deep Dive into Cognitive Abilities. The Digital Cognitive Skills Assessment tool goes beyond conventional cognitive testing. It employs standardized and validated tests designed to measure a spectrum of cognitive skills such as coordination, attention, memory, perception, and reasoning. Delving even deeper, the tool evaluates twenty additional neuro-psychological parameters, all through engaging and straightforward computer-based games, taking just 20-40 minutes of an individual’s time.
Bridging Gaps in Healthcare and Education. The potential applications of this innovative tool are manifold for Neurologists, Psychiatrists, Pediatricians, and Psychologists. The results from the brain function tests can significantly aid in the neurorehabilitation of patients suffering from strokes and traumatic brain injuries (TBI). For geriatric care, this simple cognitive assessment is an essential tool in understanding memory decline among seniors, providing invaluable insights for both individuals and healthcare professionals to develop timely interventions and monitoring.
However, the impact of the Digital Cognitive Skills Assessment extends far beyond healthcare. In the realm of education, the validated algorithms of the tool can assess the cognitive strengths and weaknesses of students, including those who are neurodiverse. Such insights are instrumental for educators and school boards, enabling the development and implementation of individualized, brain-based learning strategies. It’s a move towards a more inclusive and holistic educational environment, catering to the diverse needs of all students.
Orange Neurosciences has launched a comprehensive Cognitive Skills Assessment (CSA-Pro), CSA-ACAD for students, CSA-MEM and CSA-ATN, the brain tests for assessing memory and attention, respectively. Additional tests will be launched soon.
A Vision for a Brain-Centric Future. As Orange Neurosciences steps into this new chapter, it envisions a future where understanding the intricacies of the brain is seamlessly integrated into our daily lives, healthcare, and education. The launch of the Digital Cognitive Skills Assessment is a significant stride towards realizing this vision, bridging gaps, and unlocking the boundless potential of the human mind. Orange Neurosciences is at the forefront of this shift, fostering a deeper understanding of cognitive functions and their practical applications.
“The advancement in cognitive assessment brought forth by Orange Neurosciences marks a pivotal moment in brain health and education,” said Dr. Vinay Singh, CEO of Orange Neurosciences. “By harnessing the power of technology and in-depth research, we are opening doors to a new era of personalized learning and healthcare,” added Dr. Singh.

BEE-SEO is a not-for-profit organization launched in the spring of 2023 with a mandate to support and create programs and services to help Black business owners and entrepreneurs in this region overcome the unique challenges they face.
Local entrepreneur and businessman Dan Desjardins was inspired by the vision of BEE-SEO.
“Distributive believes that entrepreneurial ecosystems are made stronger when everyone is welcome to the table and when everyone can pitch in. The best way to support the Kingston community is to support each other and futureproof our own small business owners so we are stronger together. When seeking out products or services, we encourage Kingstonians to first look at what local Kingston companies – both established and brand new – have to offer. Support our ecosystem, buy Kingston-made,” says Dan Desjardins, CEO, Distributive.
Applications for the $500 Business Enhancement Grant for Black Entrepreneurs are now open and being accepted until March 10, 2024.
“We are thankful for the wonderful donation from Dan Desjardins of Distributive, as well as the incredible support we continue to receive from the Kingston Economic Development Corporation and other organizations. Dan’s goal is to help Black-owned businesses reach new markets, create value for customers, and generate repeat sales. BEE-SEO is excited to contribute to the economic growth of Southeastern Ontario by supporting Black Entrepreneurs on their business journey.” – Patrick Egbunonu, Board Chair, BEE-SEO
The Kingston Economic Development Corporation supports the work being done by BEE-SEO.
“The incredible support BEE-SEO has received from the Kingston community since we started is a testament to the vibrant and generous spirit of our ecosystem. Entrepreneurs like Dan Desjardins have highlighted key challenges in entrepreneurship: the difficulty lies not only in establishing a business and offering quality services but also in attracting and retaining customers.  With this contribution we will able to support 20 black-owned businesses, offering them a tangible support in their efforts to grow. This is a great way to celebrate and wrap up Black History Month,” says Norman Musengimana, Business Development Manager – Start-ups and Entrepreneurship, Kingston Economic Development.
There will be a celebration event and black entrepreneurs and business showcase on May 11, 2024 at Pedalworks.

# [Clean Technology - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/cleantech/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/cleantech/_

## CLEAN TECHNOLOGY
Kingston was the first Canadian city to adopt a protocol for sustainable energy procurement, and the first city in Ontario to declare a climate emergency.  
Kingston has a long history of chemical technology that gives the region strong and established roots in this sector. Large multinationals, Alcan and Dupont, started building research capacity in the mid-1900s. The start of the 2000s saw service companies like Kingston Process Metallurgy and GreenCentre Canada add to Kingston’s capacity in chemical processing, giving it, per capita, **one of the highest densities of chemical process experts in the country.** This physical and human infrastructure has fostered the third wave of chemical-based start-up companies establishing in Kingston. Cyclic Materials, CAST Technologies, Kingston Aluminum Technologies, and Advonex, are all examples of companies that have been established in the area because of the existing assets. Supporting organizations like KPM-Accelerate, GreenCentre Canada, and Queen’s University interact to give start-ups a continuous path to commercialization.
Kingston also hosts several local companies in the cleantech space such as Kingston Aluminum Technology which benefit from an integrated cluster of over 100 manufacturing companies supporting the cleantech scene in the city, with industry foci including production technology and heavy machinery, and upstream metal manufacturing 
Kingston is also home to a number of innovation and commercialization hubs, such as Launch Lab and Queen’s Innovation Centre. The city enjoys facilitated access to skilled labour from research and post-secondary institutions including Queen’s University, the Royal Military College of Canada, and St. Lawrence College.

# [V2 Innovations Offering Unique Solutions for People with Mobility or Physical Vulnerabilities - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/v2innovations-offering-unique-solutions-for-people-with-mobility-or-physical-vulnerabilities/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/v2innovations-offering-unique-solutions-for-people-with-mobility-or-physical-vulnerabilities/_

November 2022 – Every year, V2 Innovations, an innovative prostheses/orthoses Kingston company, performs small miracles for more than 2,500 clients.
When an eastern Ontario firefighter lost his leg in a motorcycle accident a few years ago, V2 Innovations offered a high-tech solution that saved his career. They customized a state-of-the-art prostheses originally designed for US military veterans (cost: $120,000) and developed a therapy regime that put him back on his feet and eventually onto a firetruck again.
Another client was fitted with prosthetic hands so she could compete in equestrian events at the Special Olympics.
Not all their successes are headline grabbers but each day, V2’s expertise changes the lives of disabled children, aging adults with mobility challenges, high-performance athletes, injured veterans, and anyone else who needs an assistive device to live a fuller life.
V2 Innovations boutique clinic is an important part of Kingston’s burgeoning healthcare ecosystem, it provides its clientele crucial access to the world’s most advanced orthoses and prostheses, and crucial therapy programs. By staying current with technological advances such as computerized knee joints and electrical nerve stimulation, the V2 team customizes solutions to meet the needs and goals of people making life-altering decisions. When the adaptation of existing state-of-the-art devices won’t suffice, V2 technicians build their own in the company’s modern workshop.
Founder AJ Venter, a South African medical orthotist and prosthetist who moved to Canada in 2001, says, “We are always looking at new innovations – from carbon fibre to 3-D printing. We apply technology with a custom focus, on a case-by-case basis.” There is no single fix or mass production in his world. 
Venter is a marathon kayaker who understands an athlete’s desire to reach the next level physically and mentally and helps clients reach it.
“Not everyone knows what’s available,” he says. “Really, the sky is the limit.”
Venter and V2 Innovations partner Marty Robertson sees a bright future ahead as technical advances offer new horizons for eastern Ontarians with a range of needs. One promising advance is the use of functional electrical systems (FES) that stimulate nerves to assist walking for people with central nervous system impairment. Venter has a decade’s experience working with FES devices by Bioness, an innovative California medical-device company.
Each new client starts with a thorough assessment that considers strength, range of motion and past interventions. Once individual goals are identified — some as basic as standing 10 minutes a day, others to win a gold medal — the V2 team devises a strategy that combines devices and therapy. Venter is especially enthusiastic about introducing spinal cord injury clients to adaptive sports.
“We provide lots of follow up. It is important to keep clients safe and give them confidence in whatever device we provide,” says Venter who admits the work can be an emotional business for both V2’s staff and their clients.
“Sometimes there are tears,” he admits. “Sometimes happy tears. Sometimes tears of disappointment… It’s not clinical. We’re in a lifelong relationship.”
Right now, V2’s nine-member staff works out of two locations in Kingston: an east end facility for client assessments and the creation and modification of devices, and a west end therapy clinic.
V2’s Kingston location gives the company easy access to Queen’s University. Both partners are guest lecturers at its School of Rehabilitative Therapy and the company participates in collaborative research with the university’s Mechanical and Materials Engineering Department.
“Clearly, both V2 and our community are well matched,” says Kingston Economic Development’s CEO Donna Gillespie. “While V2 draws clients from all across eastern Ontario including CFB Kingston, it also benefits as a member of our innovative healthcare sector with access to Queen’s University and our medical institutions. Their customized products and services are a game changer for their client’s quality of life.”

# [Water Tests in 2 Hours not 2 Days: TECTA-PDS - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/water-tests-in-2-hours-not-2-days-tecta-pds/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/water-tests-in-2-hours-not-2-days-tecta-pds/_

As the problem of tainted drinking water becomes more acute, TECTAPDS, a high-tech Kingston company has found customers around the globe for its compact, automated water testing devices.
Models of its compact lab-in-a-box can test multiple water samples at the same time. TECTA-PDS touts them as the world’s first and only “all-inone, self-contained, rapid-automated microbial test for E-coli, coliforms and enterococcus bacteria.” (All other systems use manual, lab-based methods that require 2-3 days for testing.)
Cartridges containing water samples are simply placed in the device where they undergo analysis at the flip of a switch. Users require minimal training and results are available in as little as two hours.
Assembled by Kingston’s Bojack Manufacturing, they sell in the range of $12,000-$21,000 US.
Work on the technology began at Queen’s University when Dr. Stephen Brown, a chemistry and environmental sciences professor, combined advanced chemistry with state-of-the-art optical systems and portable incubators to test water. TECTA-PDS was founded shortly afterwards in 2003, sold to French water company VEOLIA Environment in 2009, and after a major expansion, reacquired in a 2016 buy-out led by current CEO Doug Wilton.
Originally inspired by a tragic 2000 drinking-water accident that sickened hundreds of residents in Walkerton, Ontario, the company’s devices have now found their way into almost 100 indigenous communities across Canada, as well as water systems in 50 countries.
A variety of agencies use the devices to test both drinking and waste water; they have been particularly useful in isolated locales and at the scene of natural disasters where easy access to laboratories is often impossible. A TECTA system was used at the Tokyo Olympics to test all open-water sports venues.
Working from its office/lab in downtown Kingston, the 12-person TECTA-PDS team is expanding its product line and extending its testing solution beyond water into the medical, food and personal care industries.

# [Growing Knowledge - Dr. Yafan Huang - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/growing-knowledge-dr-yafan-huang/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/growing-knowledge-dr-yafan-huang/_

As Dr. Yafan Huang completed his high school studies, the field of molecular genetics was still in its early days. But he was fascinated by genetics and could see the potential impact it would have in the future.
After completing both a bachelor’s and master’s degree at China’s Jinan University to deepen his knowledge on the subject, Yafan knew there was more to learn. He turned his attention to North America.
In 1989, Yafan received a scholarship to attend Mount Allison University in New Brunswick and completed a second master’s degree in plant biochemistry. Still, he wanted to learn more. He looked into the top university in Canada at the time for plant biology – Queen’s University.
“I wanted to continue to advance knowledge in plant metabolism and molecular biology and Queen’s University was leading the way at the time,” he said.
As his studies progressed, Yafan’s dedication and knowledge caught the attention of his professors. While Yafan and his wife, Dr. Jiangxin Wan, a fellow biology graduate of Queen’s University, were completing their post-doctoral training in Chicago, they received a call inviting them to join a new company.
“One of my biggest beliefs is that we must use what we learn to create products and technologies that can benefit people and society,” Yafan said of his decision to join Performance Plants. “I like to devote all my energy to making knowledge available.”
Performance Plants was founded in 1995 by four Queen’s University professors to leverage their research findings, which looked at increasing crop yields. The couple returned to Kingston and began with the company as senior scientist, where they contributed to 86 of Performance Plants’ patent applications. Before long, Yafan became the company’s Director of Research, then in 2010, its President and Chief Scientific Officer, and in 2022, it’s Chief Executive Officer.
“The company’s work has been building for a long time,” he said. “It takes years to develop strong products in our industry and I believe the next five years will be the most exciting. In the next five years, the products we have invented here in Kingston will be arriving in the hands of the farmers around the world.”
Yafan’s ascension was part of a push at Performance Plants to commercialize its technology and that decision has paid off. In 2014, Performance Plants received the Agrow Award for Best Industry Collaboration, recognizing its successful commercialization strategy. The company was also a finalist in the research and development pipeline in the international competition.
“We celebrated the awards the Performance Plants way – quietly!” Yafan said. “We’re like a big family, and we all share in the success.”
Staying in Kingston may not have been Yafan’s original plan but it provided the perfect atmosphere for his type of business – a quiet, supportive city with a lot of talent.
“If you are in the technology business, Kingston has this constant influx of talented people thanks to its post-secondary institutions,” he said. “Organizations like Kingston Economic Development Corporation have also been very supportive in helping us apply to grants and make connections.”
Yafan’s success and expertise has not gone unnoticed outside of Kingston. He served as the president of Canadian Association for Plant Biotechnology from 2014 to 2018 and he was Canada’s national correspondent with the International Association for Plant Biotechnology. Yafan has also served on the Board of Directors for the Kingston Economic Development Corporation since 2019.
The awards, accolades, and titles are nice to have but for Yafan, it comes back to the impact of the research.
“There’s an urgent need to increase food production and find new sources of energy,” he says. “If we can enhance crop yields under the increasing threat of global climate volatility, we can better secure our food. We can build on the plant’s genetic strengths and turn them into productive plants.”

# [Office Pod Manufacturer SnapCab Looks Toward Expansion - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/office-pod-manufacturer-snapcab-looks-toward-expansion/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/office-pod-manufacturer-snapcab-looks-toward-expansion/_

Kingston, Ontario, September 15, 2022 – [SnapCab](https://snapcab.com/) announced a plan to expand their Kingston, Ontario manufacturing facility, prompting a visit from Bryan Paterson, the mayor of Kingston. Paterson toured the building with CEO and Founder Glenn Bostock, learning about the company’s history, culture, and systems.
To meet the increased demand for safe, private workspaces from employees returning to work after the pandemic, Bostock is looking toward the future by planning an expansion of the Canadian facility. The project will be undertaken in a phased approach. The company has chosen a builder to work on Phase 1, which is the site plan application process. An additional 18,000 square feet is projected to be built adjacent to the existing 36,000 square-foot building.
At the beginning of the pandemic, Bostock and his employees were concerned about business coming to a halt. But they redirected their energies to developing products that would be of service during a pandemic: office pods with the proper air filtration, pods with a window divider and separate air flow for face-to-face meetings, and solo pods to facilitate working from home. They also innovated a medical triage pod, the [SnapCab Care](https://vimeo.com/553492526). The first of its kind was installed in Kingston’s Covid Assessment Centre, providing privacy and a focused space in a large open room.
Bostock started the company in Southeastern Pennsylvania 39 years ago, making elevator interior paneling. Over the years he grew the company by innovating a remodeling system with interlocking panels, reducing install times to one day, and by adopting lean manufacturing methods. In a major leveling up, he extended the interlocking panel concept and lean principles to wall paneling and office pod kits. SnapCab maintains a large facility in Warrington, Pennsylvania with 80 employees. In 2014 they opened a second facility in Kingston dedicated to manufacturing a variety of workspace products. They continue to focus on lean systems, innovation, and meeting needs. Over the years, SnapCab has received continuous support from local agencies such as the [Kingston Economic Development Corporation](http://www.investkingston.ca/), as well as others. This support has been key in connecting SnapCab with information and networking opportunities. The company has seen huge growth since 2018. The Kingston location currently employs 43 people.
SnapCab was recently recognized for their innovative designs with [HiP honoree awards](https://interiordesign.net/award/hip-award-winners-2022/) for both the [Meet 2](https://workspace.snapcab.com/pages/meet-2-pod?__hstc=753710.e6659285baa6d00fe49772919c0f214f.1650646057184.1657215921904.1657222105360.26&__hssc=753710.1.1657222105360&__hsfp=501963141) and the [Work](https://workspace.snapcab.com/pages/work-pod?__hstc=753710.e6659285baa6d00fe49772919c0f214f.1650646057184.1657215921904.1657222105360.26&__hssc=753710.1.1657222105360&__hsfp=501963141) in the Workspace Pods & Wall Systems category at Chicago’s [NeoCon](https://neocon.com/)®, the world’s top commercial interior design event.

“Our first Cross Border Conference on Health Innovation covered global health, vaccine development, living with COVID-19 and pandemic planning; connecting to communities for health access, new tech adoption, reimaging the hospital, Lyme disease research, SMART cities, workforce challenges and ended with an exciting pitch program by US- and Canadian-based early stage start- ups.

“Congratulations to the organizers on a successful Kingston-Syracuse Pathway Cross Border Conference. It was an energizing and informative day of sessions covering research and innovation topics related to current and future health care challenges. And, as the conference finale, the pitches from five start-ups showcased a promising future as these companies bring their health-related innovations to the marketplace. A special thanks to the attendees that travelled from upstate New York to attend this conference,” says Jim Banting, Associate Vice-Principal Partnerships & Innovation at Queen’s University.

Their mission is to help women manage their Breast Cancer so that they can live a long and fulfilling life.
With world-class institutions from both sides of the border, the Kingston-Syracuse Pathway Cross Boarder Conference provided an opportunity to discuss and collaboration to advance research in key areas on health innovation.
“It was truly wonderful to see Syracuse and Kingston researchers, mayors, industry and medical professionals connect and collaborate.

# [Kingston will feature the launch of Voltari's Fully Electric Performance Boat - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/kingston-will-feature-the-launch-of-canadas-first-commercially-available-electric-boat/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/kingston-will-feature-the-launch-of-canadas-first-commercially-available-electric-boat/_

June, 2022 – Kingston will feature in a new chapter of Canadian nautical history this Canada Day with the launch of the Voltari 260.
The 26-foot power EV-boat, built on the popular centre-console design, is a versatile, all-purpose craft suitable for fishing, waterskiing, cottage use and family outings. It’s suitable for inland waters like the Muskoka Lakes and Thousand Islands but can also handle wakes and rougher off-shore chop due to its deep-V hull design. Its revolutionary combination of a lightweight carbon-fibre hull and a powerful 160kWH lithium-ion battery yield a comfortable cruising speed of 35 mph, a top speed of 70mph and a range of 100 nautical miles–a full day’s use–on a single charge.
Voltari CEO Cam Heaps, co-founder of Steam Whistle Brewing, is unveiling the company’s first factory demo boat in Kingston on July 1st with a spin on Lake Ontario. (Production of the first hundred 260s has already started, at a price tag of US$397,000, with several Canadian customers already set to take delivery in 2022.)
Although most of Voltari’s new EV-boats will find their way to customers in Florida and the Caribbean, they feature distinctive Canadian technology. The lithium-ion batteries are built-in Montreal, the fibre carbon hulls are crafted in Arnprior, and the components are assembled at Voltari’s boatworks in Merrickville. Test runs between Kingston and the cottage of Voltari president Tim Markou near Ivy Lea in the Thousand Islands have been ongoing since 2021.
Heaps has been passionate about offshore boating since his teens but got serious about it in Florida when the economic crisis of 2008 offered bargain-basement prices for expensive fibre glass power boats built for island hopping. In 2015, he began experimenting with high-performance carbon-fibre hulls that trimmed off thousands of pounds to improve speed and fuel economy.
It was only a matter of time before he made the leap to EV-boats.
By matching a lightweight 1,500-pound carbon-fibre hull to a 3,000-pound battery/propulsion system, the Voltari engineering team created an EV-boat that could go further and faster than their competitors. Best of all, there were zero emissions and no noise.
“You never forget your first time being on an electric boat,” Heaps says. “There is no engine noise. You just hear the water off the back of the boat – and the person talking beside you.”
On board, there are few obvious signs of the 260’s electric pedigree. But its quick — and quiet — acceleration proves the advantage of its computer-controlled chain of seven battery packs that provide power to its electric motor, drive, and prop. Voltari owners will also enjoy skipping the lineup for fuel, as the boat recharges overnight. Its high-capacity battery can also provide backup power to a cottage in the event of an electrical blackout.
Kingston Economic Development CEO Donna Gillespie welcomes the Voltari team to Kingston. “We are so pleased that Voltari chose Kingston as the site of the Voltari 260’s official launch given Kingston’s commitment to innovation and sustainability in business.”
To mark its debut, Voltari has partnered with the City of Kingston to install Canada’s first EV-boat charging station at the city’s Confederation Basin Marina across the street from Kingston’s historic city hall.

# [Regenerative Medicine Innovators Accelerating Health - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/regenerative-medicine-innovators-accelerating-health/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/regenerative-medicine-innovators-accelerating-health/_

Dr. Tim Smith started his health science career researching medical devices as a graduate student at Queen’s University in the late 1980s. Somewhere along the line he chose a career in regenerative medicine — using natural biology to repair the body — over artificial implants.
Today, he and Octane Medical cofounder Ian Grant, have bet their future on the science of growing tissue to restore sick and damaged bodies.
“It’s a $20 billion industry this year,” Tim says. “And it’s growing to $100 billion by 2035.”
With a staff of 130, they oversee Octane’s five commercial medical divisions that include Octane Ortho (tissue-engineering for cartilage replacement), Octane Clinical Systems (radioisotope-based medical imaging), and Octane EXO (spinal implants for degenerative disc disease).
Their 40,000 square-foot facility next to Highway 401 is a completely repurposed industrial building whose interior has a sci-fi vibe thanks to its bio labs, network of clean rooms and next-generation manufacturing floor that annually produces hundreds of thousands of medical devices, biomaterials and instrumentation for international markets.
“We compare costs globally,” Tim says about their decision to keep their manufacturing in-house. “And we continue to be competitive in product cost here.”
An international company based primarily on Canadian science, Octane 
continues to have strong ties to Queen’s and other universities through internships and placement programs, as well as sponsoring graduate research.
Both co-founders have decades-old ties to Kingston and continue to see their future there.
“It’s a wonderful place to live and work,” says Tim. “It’s a supportive community and the location (between Montreal, Toronto and the U.S) really works.”

# [Virtualized Hybrid Computing in Any Environment - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/3095-2/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/3095-2/_

Dr. Daniel Desjardins, an ex-RCAF pilot with a PhD in physics and computational electro-dynamics, has assembled a team of programmers and mathematicians that is about to turn the mega-billion-dollar business of cloud computing upside down. Their Kings Distributed Systems (KDS) startup has spent 200,000 hours and $7 million dollars perfecting a computersharing system designed to put idle computers to work.
Simply explained, KDS uses Distributed Compute Protocol to allow computer owners — individuals, corporations, school boards, hospitals to name a few — to “rent” KDS time on any of their computer processors that aren’t being used.
For example, the owner of a single laptop with eight processors might only be using one of them to browse the internet, so the rest can be put to use working on seven mathematical calculations while the computer is logged onto the network. Such private clients are paid in credits that can be redeemed for small amounts of cash.
That is the small scale. (Enter dcp. work on your browser and push START to try it.)
The HUGE scale is using thousands of desktop computers (and GPU servers) in a large organization to power its own processing needs instead of spending tens of thousands of dollars a month on American cloud-based servers. KDS processing (measured in CPUs) is about 6.7% of the cost of cloud processors like Amazon. Companies can buy additional CPU power through KDS’s network.
Hospital clients are now using its own computers to tackle the complicated computations needed to optimize the scheduling of its operating rooms. Many computers in the hospital have screensavers that automatically connect to KDS’s system during down time. The hospital saves money while processing the algorithms that help solve a crucial medical crisis — and none of their data leaves the building.
After four years of development, KDS is now staffing up in preparation to take the world of cloud-computing by storm.

# [New Not-For-Profit Academy to Support Kingston Organizations - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/new-not-for-profit-academy-to-support-kingston-organizations/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/new-not-for-profit-academy-to-support-kingston-organizations/_

Kingston, Ontario – October 21, 2024 – Kingston Economic Development Corporation, in partnership with The Community Foundation for Kingston & Area, is launching a new workshop series designed to help not-for-profit organizations tackle specific but common business challenges. The series, called the Not-For-Profit Academy, will not only provide expert-led training but also serve as a networking opportunity for participants to connect, share challenges, and learn from each other.
The series will begin with two marketing-focused workshops. The first session, Strategic Communication Planning, will be delivered virtually on October 30, 2024, from 1:00 to 2:30 PM by marketing experts Adam Walker and Phil Gaudreau. The second session, Audience Mapping and Key Messages for Not-For-Profits will be delivered virtually on November 13, 2024, from 1:00 to 2:30 PM by the same marketing specialists.
Not-for-profit organizations are important components of the Kingston economy with over 150 registered groups employing residents. “Through the Not-For-Profit Academy, we aim to equip these organizations with practical tools and strategies to enhance their operational effectiveness and long-term sustainability,” said Donna Gillespie, CEO of Kingston Economic Development Corporation.
This initiative has been co-developed with The Community Foundation for Kingston & Area, which plays a critical role in supporting the city’s charitable sector. “The Community Foundation is committed to building the capacity of our non-profit sector partners to be able to thrive and focus on achieving their mission,” said Stacy Kelly, Executive Director of Community Foundation for Kingston & Area. “We have created the Not-For-Profit Academy as a critical supplement to our longstanding granting programs.”
The Not-For-Profit Academy workshops are being carefully curated to address specific gaps that business developers from Kingston Economic Development have identified through consultations with not-for-profits. “Working closely with not-for-profit leaders, we’ve seen the challenges they face from strategic communication, revenue generation, governance and resources, among others,” said Rob Tamblyn, Business Development Manager, Small & Medium Enterprises at Kingston Economic Development. “These workshops will offer them actionable insights that can make a real difference in their operations.”
Not-for-profits significantly impact Kingston’s economy, contributing to employment and service provision in areas with unmet needs. In 2021, Canada’s non-profit sector employed 2.5 million people, with Ontario contributing 33% of that workforce. In Canada, the non-profit sector contributed 9% to the national GDP in 2020.

# [Testing Food Destined For The Chinese Market - CCIC Canada - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/testing-food-destined-for-the-chinese-market-ccic-canada/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/testing-food-destined-for-the-chinese-market-ccic-canada/_

September 2022 – Kingston’s path to global markets has just widened with the arrival of an international food-and-agriculture testing laboratory. In February, CCIC Canada, a subsidiary of China Certification and Inspection Corporation (CCIC) Group, opened its first North American biological and chemical lab in Kingston.
Currently, the $4 million, 20,000 square-foot facility is aimed specifically at the testing and certification of milk and corn products being exported to China from Ontario and Quebec. Its first major client is also its closest neighbour on Kingston’s Venture Drive — Canada Royal Milk, a processing plant that makes infant formula from local dairy and goat milk.
In preparation for future growth, CCIC Canada’s Kingston laboratory is also expanding its services to other agricultural and food products that require testing and certification before sale to domestic markets.
Internationally, CCIC Group serves clients around the world, offering internationally recognized certification to facilitate the import to China of a wide variety of goods including food, grain, agricultural products, machinery, cosmetics, auto parts and garments. The company’s independent analysis is designed to smooth an exporter’s entry into a market that has very strict standards. China’s national standards, known as Guobiao (GB), more or less match those of the International Standards Organization (ISO) that are crucial to entering European markets.
CCIC Group not only tests products to ensure their quality but it provides expertise in navigating complex import systems that can involve multiple levels of compliance in areas of quality, safety, health, environmental protection and even labelling. The 42-year-old corporation’s special focus is China – the world’s largest trading country and a dream destination for many manufacturers that may not have the internal resources to handle China’s rigid import process. Even small discrepancies in labelling and the incorrect use of Chinese characters can prevent approval of an otherwise acceptable product.
CCIC Canada’s new laboratory launched with 10 local employees but expects to triple its team as more clients seek its expertise to ease access to the Chinese market through its impartial testing programs. Servicing new clients focused on the domestic market will also feed that growth.
“While it’s aimed at Ontario and Quebec food producers in general, CCIC Canada’s new Kingston laboratory could play an important role in helping our local food companies sell into the Chinese market,” says Donna Gillespie, CEO of Kingston Economic Development. “Dealing with international customers can be daunting so CCIC can become a valuable partner. We are pleased they have chosen Kingston as the site of their first laboratory in Canada.”

# [mDETECT Launches Breast Cancer Liquid Biopsy Clinical Trial - Kingston Economic Development Corporation](https://www.investkingston.ca/mdetect-launches-breast-cancer-liquid-biopsy-clinical-trial/) 
 _https://www.investkingston.ca/mdetect-launches-breast-cancer-liquid-biopsy-clinical-trial/_

March 2023 – mDETECT Inc.– a liquid biopsy company based on DNA methylation is pleased to announce that Dr. Christopher Mueller, Professor in the Cancer Research Institute of Queen’s University and founder of mDETECT-Inc, was recently awarded a $900k grant from the Canadian Institute of Health Research (CIHR). The funding will support a clinical trial which will validate the clinical utility of the company’s breast cancer liquid biopsy in women undergoing treatment for metastatic breast cancer. The test, which identifies specific cancer signatures based on DNA methylation patterns, is one of the few methylation-based liquid biopsies. “There is growing evidence that methylation-based assays are highly sensitive, can be applied in more universal cancer settings and have a broad range of potential applications” says the Co-founder and Development Officer Dr. Irsa Shoukat.
This funding will be pivotal for mDETECT’s mission to help oncologists make decisions about changes in therapy for metastatic patients. The breast cancer test is the first of a number of cancer-specific mDETECT assays to reach this scale of clinical trial, but others are in advanced stages of development with trials in ovarian and pancreatic cancer expected to start soon. The firm’s tests provide a rapid assessment of tumour burdens allowing oncologists to quickly and confidently determine if a particular treatment is effective. “This funding will allow us to start trials in Kingston and Ottawa and are important for demonstrating clinical utility, which will hopefully lead to early adoption of mDETECT. We want to be able to start helping women as soon as possible” says Dr. Mueller.
The company hopes to raise a Series A round in the coming year to help accelerate multiple clinical trials and business development and implementation of mDETECT.
