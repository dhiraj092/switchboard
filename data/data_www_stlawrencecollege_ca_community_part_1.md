# [Global Learning Opportunities Week (GLOW)](https://www.stlawrencecollege.ca/learn/global-learning/glow) 
 _https://www.stlawrencecollege.ca/learn/global-learning/glow_

[Top](#top)
###### Tuesday, January 28th, 2025 - Friday, January 31st, 2025
Global Learning Opportunities Week (GLOW) aims to bring the SLC community together to celebrate, learn and raise awareness of various cultural perspectives from Canada and around the world. Join us for various events throughout the week and help us foster and promote our intercultural and global mindset.
#### **Multicultural Fair**
* **Kingston** | Upper Concourse: Wednesday, January 29th 11 AM – 2 PM
* **Cornwall** | Aultsville Hall: Thursday, January 30th 11 AM – 2 PM
* **Brockville** | TBD: Tuesday, January 28th 11 AM – 2 PM
The multicultural fair allows students to proudly showcase their cultural heritage, which displays the many cultures represented in our SLC community. Attendees can see or taste something new or familiar. They had the opportunity to learn new songs or a few phrases in a new language. This fun opportunity allowed the SLC community to learn about the cultures represented from around the world. 
#### **Human Books: Read Between the Minds**
Do you know you can check out a human book? You will have an informal conversation with someone who comes from various cultural backgrounds and life experiences. The conversations will be held for 30-minute slots and more than one participant can check out the same book with a maximum of three per human book. Human Library promotes acceptance, celebrates differences and challenges our own assumptions and beliefs. It is a great way to learn and connect through storytelling!
* Within GLOW week (depending on the availability of Human Books/Speakers)

## Overview
The Residential Air Conditioning Systems Mechanic program offered at St. Lawrence College includes the in-school training of the 313D Residential Air Conditioning Systems Mechanic Apprenticeship as defined by the Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development.
Level 1 Apprenticeship Program Code 1164\*
Level 2 Apprenticeship Program Code 1165
\*Note: Level 1 is a common core level with 313A Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Systems Mechanic. 313A apprentices are eligible to be registered in level 1 of this program.
Program length is 15 weeks in total in each level with 12 weeks of theory classes delivered online in conjunction with 3 continuous weeks of in-person practical learning at Kingston campus. The only requirement to be in-person on campus is during the 3 weeks of practical learning. This innovative hybrid delivery provides the apprentice with flexibility to work full-time while engaged in online learning and minimizes the number of weeks the apprentice is released from work compared to traditional block training. Completing the in-school and on-the-job training usually takes about four years.
This program is funded in part by the Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development.
Learn more about **[Apprenticeships in Ontario](https://www.ontario.ca/page/apprenticeship-ontario)**. For start dates, contact the **[Employment Ontario apprenticeship office](https://www.ontario.ca/page/employment-ontario-apprenticeship-offices)** in your area.

Credential Statement of Achievement/College Certificate
Campus Kingston
Program Length Part-time online (weekday evenings) for 12 weeks & full-time in-person for 3 weeks in each level of training
Delivery Apprenticeship
For start dates, contact the Employment Ontario apprenticeship office in your area. 
## Program Highlights
The Skilled Trades Ontario curriculum delivered in this program coupled with on-the-job training will enable the apprentice to install, maintain and service air conditioning systems, heat pumps, and refrigeration systems in residential settings.
The innovative hybrid delivery of this program allows professionals in the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) field to maintain full-time employment while learning theory subjects online in the evenings. The practical learning is delivered over 3 weeks in-person, minimizing the amount of time one must spend in full-time training to complete each level.
Apprentices who complete this program will be trained to install and service heat pumps. Such skilled tradespeople are in high demand as more and more homeowners across Ontario replace air conditioning systems with heat pumps and choose heat pumps as their primary source of home heating to reduce carbon emissions. A skilled tradesperson working with heat pumps can find themselves in a rewarding career with opportunities for growth, job security, and the satisfaction of contributing to a more sustainable future.

## 2024 Honorary Diploma Recipients
## Lindsey Belch
**CEO, Girls Inc., Kingston**
**What does this award mean to you personally?**
St. Lawrence College is my alma mater, and my work at Girls Inc. has been intertwined with the College for more than 30 years now. It is such an honour to have been even nominated for this very special award. Being considered and selected by the Board of Governors for my work in our community is truly a highlight of my career.
**How have SLC students or the College in general intersected with your work or community?**
I have been the CEO of Girls Inc. Limestone since 1992. We provide programs and support for more than 1,500 girls, women and gender-expansive individuals every year to overcome adversity, be safe in this world, and prepare for financial self-sufficiency.
St. Lawrence College has been an instrumental partner in our work and growth. We are proud of the fact that most of our 15 staff members are St. Lawrence grads. This has been the case since we were founded in 1972 and will continue long into the future.
We have also been fortunate to have placement students work by our side to provide direct support to our program participants. We regularly have Social Service Worker and Child and Youth Care students on board and welcome interns from any program relevant to our work. We greatly appreciate this hands-on support and always give first consideration to our past and current students for paid positions.
Over the years, we have participated in many speaking opportunities at the Kingston campus. Through our partnerships and connections three College staff members have joined on our Board of Directors who are dedicated to driving our mission forward in the community.
We have also gravitated to the College's exceptional event spaces, where we hosted our Annual Art Auction from 2006 to 2009. We now host our annual Girls Summit in the Event Centre for 150 girls and gender-expansive young people.
**What path have you followed that sees you here today? What were some ingredients of your success?**
During my studies at St. Lawrence College, I engaged in the college community, joining the student newspaper team as Entertainment Editor of "The Nomad." I had no idea at that time that this joining and belonging would become a key part of my education and personal and work life that followed. This was the start of my understanding that a critical ingredient to success is to develop meaningful, authentic relationships - personally and professionally. To pay attention and focus more on others and less on myself. To always look for the bright side in every situation. To listen carefully to understand the needs of others and never assume I know. And to do what I can do to help.
I graduated with a School of Business diploma in Advertising and Public Relations in 1982. The timing was terrible as we were at the height of one of the two most serious recessions in Canadian history. This became an unexpected fork in my path, resulting in me taking positions unrelated to my field for some time to make a living.
It was also immediately following my graduation that I contacted Big Sisters in Kingston and signed up. I became a Big Sister to an amazing girl, and for almost six years, we kept each other company, learning and growing together.
A few years into my time as a Big Sister, I was asked to join the Board of Directors. I again belonged to something larger than myself and learned how to make good decisions while keeping the most important factors in mind – the impact on those we work for.
Although not part of my original plan, this time was formative because I learned to work hard. To not give up or in, and to always strive to make ends meet in difficult times. By adding this experience to my public relations and business abilities gained in college, I was fully prepared and ready for the most important role in my career I would take on in 1992 – the Executive Director of Big Sisters of Kingston – now Girls Inc. of Limestone, Algonquin and Lakeshore.
Another critical part of my journey was recognizing and pursuing learning opportunities when I needed more information or education to excel in my role and lead our team. Over the years, I have participated in formal and informal educational opportunities in executive leadership, governance and administration, adult education and empowerment, graphic design, diversity, equity and inclusion, and others. I have also hired and guided many seasoned social workers and new graduates. I support our team and ensure they take care of themselves while they take care of others and encourage them to discover their strengths, learn new skills and take on new tasks.
In my personal life, I have used my life-long love of music to achieve balance in my work and personal life, writing songs and playing guitar and keys in performing bands. My bandmates and I have worked for years on numerous festival boards to provide gig opportunities for women in our community.
Finally, one of the most important factors to the success of my work and, in turn, our agency is that I have been all in. Engaged, hard-working, and grateful. I have been ready and willing to take on whatever tasks are needed to achieve our goal of eradicating inequity to improve the experiences and opportunities for girls, women and gender-expansive people and change the world.
**Who has been your biggest inspiration, and why?**
I am inspired by those around me every day and always have been. It is what keeps me going and always striving to improve. I was very fortunate to have amazing familial support in all ways during my formative years and beyond. Their support gave me the strength and inspiration to choose a path at the age of 17 and confidently follow the unexpectedly winding road I travelled on as it unfolded.
The exceptionally high quality and life-changing support provided to our participants by Girls Inc. staff members is a significant source of inspiration for me. Every staff member provides nurturing, creative, and often emotionally difficult support to more than 1,500 individuals every year. Our staff's service excellence and participants' successful outcomes highly motivate me to raise the funds we need to decrease our waiting lists and serve more girls, women and gender-expansive individuals who need our help.
But our participants themselves have been the most significant source of my inspiration for more than 30 years. Despite many having seemingly insurmountable, intersectional barriers, they desire a better life for themselves and, often, for their children. They work very hard to overcome the significant inequities that hinder them from finishing high school or attending post-secondary, trade school, or other career paths. Many are unhoused or have insecure or unsafe housing. A very high percentage have been victims of gender-based violence. Many have mental health concerns or disabilities. Obstacles are heightened even further for our BIPOC, 2SLGBTQIA+, or racially diverse participants.
Yet, in almost every case, when provided support that meets their individual needs, they set and meet goals to achieve self-sufficiency. As I read the notes of appreciation we often receive, I am inspired by their tenacity and hard work. I am proud of our team, and I am grateful for the winding path that has led me here.
**What words of inspiration/wisdom can you share with SLC graduates?**
Every one of us has our own winding path to follow. Having made that first step in choosing your field and working hard at your studies, you've finally arrived here - a graduate of St. Lawrence College. CONGRATULATIONS! Savour this moment and celebrate with your classmates, family and friends. You are amazing.
Then, take a deep breath and forge ahead. You will benefit from developing a 3 to 5-year plan and then taking it one step at a time. Celebrate every success and reassess and fine-tune your plan at every fork in the road.
Always seek opportunities for life-long learning to help you deepen your understanding of your work and gain new information and skills. And along the way, look for new places to belong. Your life will be richer for it, and you will be surprised how many personal and professional opportunities will be provided when you support the people around you and those in your community.
Be safe, be strong, be kind, be grateful and be sure to balance work with the things you love to do. And finally, always remember that you are amazing just the way you are, and walk your path - wherever it may lead - with confidence.
**Lindsey will accept her award in Kingston on Friday, June 14 at 3 pm.**
## Michael Harris
**Founding Director, Kingston Employment and Youth Services**
**What does this award mean to you personally?**  
I am touched that the nomination came from a long-time work colleague. I worked with Gillian Watters (a St. Lawrence graduate) for over 37 years. She came to KEYS as a placement student and is now Director of Employment Services.  
Also, my son will graduate from St. Lawarence this spring and getting this recognition alongside him is meaningful. I have much respect for the work of the College. In my 41 years as Executive Director at KEYS we have had placement students from the College each year. I have firsthand knowledge of the quality of those graduating.  
**How have SLC students or the college in general intersected with your work or community?**  
As noted above, in my 41 years at KEYS we have always supported students with work placements and looked to hire many after graduation. The quality of the students that have come our way has always impressed me.  In fact, two of the six members of the current KEYS Leadership Team came to KEYS as placement students. 
**What path have you followed, that sees you here today? What were some ingredients of your success?**  
In my 46 years working in the community-based sector I have often noted that my path is that of service. I would describe my leadership style as “Servant Leadership.” Services is at the core of KEYS activities, and it is at the core of my leadership philosophy. I view leadership as the development of a serving relationship with others that inspires their growth and development and inspires collective action towards a defined mission.  
**Who has been your biggest inspiration, and why?**  
My father was an early inspiration in the way that matters pertaining to equity and inclusion and was at the forefront of how he viewed the world and lived his life.  
In my 30s Ram Dass became an inspiration. I first encountered the voice of Ram Dass in 1987, via his book _How Can I Help_. Ram Dass (1931–2019) first went to India in 1967. At that time, he was still Dr. Richard Alpert, an already eminent Harvard psychologist. In this book, he provides support and inspiration for us in our efforts as members of the helping professions, as volunteers, as community activists, or simply as friends and family trying to meet each other's needs. It was also through the teaching of Ram Dass that I grew to know India and its many great spiritual teachers. I have journeyed to India on eight different occasions, and to various other parts of the world. These journeys have shaped my life.  
This quote from Anthony Bourdain resonates with me: “Travel isn’t always pretty. It isn’t always comfortable. Sometimes it hurts, it even breaks your heart. But that’s okay. The journey changes you; it should change you. It leaves marks on your memory, on your consciousness, on your heart, and on your body. You take something with you. Hopefully, you leave something good behind.” Maybe travel has been my greatest teacher. 
**What words of inspiration/wisdom can you share with SLC graduates? (A perspective or attitude to approach your career with practical advice, such as pursuing a professional designation, lifelong learning, networking, etc.)**  
My work life and travel experiences have taught me much about who I am. My message to SLC graduates is not to ignore the exploration of who you are. Look for opportunities for self-exploration. You owe it to the world to be the best version of yourself. Through the identification and mobilization of your gifts you can change the world. The Tao Te Ching states that “knowing others is wisdom; knowing the self is enlightenment.” Understanding one’s innate gifts and talents allows you to begin to develop them. 
**Michael will be awarded his Honorary Diploma in Kingston on Friday, June 14 at 10 am.**
## Neha Chugh
**Founder, Chugh Law Professional Corporation, Cornwall**
**What does this award mean to you personally?**   
This award is of tremendous meaning to me. It signifies change, a focus on equity, diversity, and inclusion, and acceptance of newcomers to this wonderful community. When I opened my law practice in Cornwall in 2014, I was a newcomer to the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas, Glengarry, and Akwesasne. The early days were not easy, but I found my way through community support and local networks. I am grateful to all the clients and community members who trusted me, often on their hardest days. 
I found my way as a lawyer in Cornwall by focusing on Chugh Law’s priorities of serving our clients, providing affordable legal services to the community, and promoting access to justice in the East region. I nurtured my support network in the community and built a strong team at Chugh Law. It is my personal goal to ensure that all newcomers to Cornwall are welcomed with compassion and respect.  
**How have SLC students or the college in general intersected with your work or community?**  
I have had the opportunity to teach at both St. Lawrence College and Iohahi:io in Akwesasne, opportunities that have been the bright spots of my career. As an Instructor, I have always felt like I have learned just as much from the students as the students learn from the curriculum. I have hired St. Lawrence College graduates and am proud of the high quality of work they continue to contribute to Chugh Law.  I have made wonderful friends who work at the college and who are passionate about honing their skills as educators – Jennifer Haley and Denise Nielson to name just a few. I am so grateful to be surrounded by the hard work and pedagogy that comes out of SLC.  
**What path have you followed, that sees you here today? What were some ingredients of your success?**  
I am what is labelled in professional circles as a “trailing spouse,” meaning I followed my husband east of our respective hometowns in south-western Ontario for his career.  At the time of our big move just over a decade ago, I was a mom to our toddler and had just given birth to our second daughter.  Life was a blur for our family, of building careers, babies, and trying to establish ourselves in a part of the world that was new to us.    
I embraced the new challenge and set out to accomplish my goal of building community capacity in Cornwall via an access to justice model at Chugh Law.  It was grit, determination, hard work, and a deep love for the law that helped our team meet these goals. Every day, our clients, the community of Cornwall, trust us to serve them. This trust is sacred to us, and in return we do our best to deliver high quality legal services.  This is a significant responsibility, one that we take very seriously. I have surrounding myself with a team of staff and lawyers with shared commitment our clients as well as Chugh Law’s goal of facilitating Access to Justice to the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas, Glengarry, and Akwesasne. 
**Who has been your biggest inspiration, and why?**
My maternal grandmother, my lovely nanima, who passed away in 2020.  She came to Canada from New Delhi, India in the 1970s, with three children. She never let them, or any of her seven grandchildren, forget the importance and magic of education.  She retrained as a teacher at York University when she came to Canada, while also working the night shift at a button factory to support the family. After she requalified as a teacher, she worked as a primary school teacher for decades with the Toronto District School Board, focusing her work on special education. She was patient and kind.  She embodied love, grit, humour, and compassion.  I miss her every day and am inspired by her memory.  When she passed away, our family was proud to create a scholarship in her name at the Faculty of Education at York University.
**What words of inspiration/wisdom can you share with SLC graduates? (A perspective or attitude to approach your career with practical advice, such as pursuing a professional designation, lifelong learning, networking, etc.)** 
Be courageous! Say yes to new opportunities that you push your boundaries of comfort and safety. You don’t know where your life is going to take you and it can be very uncomfortable to stand up for what is right. 
Growing up in India, my grandmother had no idea that she would be raising her children and working as a teacher in Toronto. Tremendous courage put her on a plane to immigrate to Canada in the 1970s. Twenty years ago, I did not see my career blossoming in a place called Cornwall, and to fall in love with serving this community.  
At that time, I was planning a completely different career as a social worker in my hometown of Guelph, not as a lawyer in eastern Ontario. Bravely saying yes to new opportunities for education and my career carved a path for me that was completely unplanned. There were so many days that were uncomfortable – bad days in court, missing my kids’ special events because I was stuck at work, tense moments with other professionals. It is ok to experience failure, but with courage and heart, my life has sent me in a positive trajectory because I maintained a good attitude, an open mind, and welcomed opportunities that were presented to me. 
Be brave!  Give yourself a voice to the community’s most vulnerable. Find your medium – writing, speaking, poetry, music, community service in the trades. Highlight your strengths and let yourself shine! 
**Neha will receive her Honorary Diploma in Cornwall on Friday, May 31 at the 10 am ceremony.**
## Sherri Fournier Hudson
**Executive Director of the Upper Canada Family Health Team, Brockville**
**What does this award mean to you personally?**  
Receiving this award is a complete surprise and a tremendous honor.  I am not one to enjoy the limelight, so this is a little outside my comfort zone. To me, this award also acknowledges the many people that I have been fortunate to work with over the years. My motto is that it takes a community to get things done. 
**How have SLC students or the college in general intersected with your work or community?**  
Working in healthcare, St. Lawrence College plays an integral role in so many areas. Specifically, the nursing and the medical administrative students and graduates have intersected with our work in the community. 
Thinking back to the Covid-19 pandemic, the students and new graduates played an instrumental role in the human resources for the Assessment Centre and the Vaccine Centre.
**What path have you followed, that sees you here today? What were some ingredients of your success?**  
Well, I am not sure you would describe it as a path… perhaps as a hike with some twists and turns!  
With quite a bit of coaxing from my dad, I attended and graduated from Georgian College with three-year Business diploma with a minor in Automotive Marketing. From there I attended Northwood University and obtained my Bachelor of Business. 
Once back working in the family business, Rockway Pontiac Buick, I applied to attend General Motors Institute in their executive studies program which I graduated from in 1994. 
In 2008, I began looking for a change in careers. Through all my education and work experience, I had learned, I had a strong passion for assisting and finding solutions specifically with people and communities. 
In Jan 2009, I made the leap into healthcare administration as the executive director with the Upper Canada Family Health Team. I have continued to upgrade my education in healthcare administration through Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto. 
**Who has been your biggest inspiration, and why?** 
I have been blessed to be surrounded by two great families: my parents and my husband’s parents. Their work ethic and involvement in the community has certainly been an inspiration to me which I carry with me every day. My husband Ted and I have been diligent to carry on from our parents’ examples; to instill work ethic and strong commitment to community in our children Catherine and Joseph. 
**What words of inspiration/wisdom can you share with SLC graduates? (A perspective or attitude to approach your career with practical advice, such as pursuing a professional designation, lifelong learning, networking, etc.)**  
Finding your passion is a key ingredient and this may take some time. Don’t be afraid to change course, embrace change! If you find your passion, you will never work another day. 
There are many ways to reach your destination and no experience is a waste whether it is education, different careers, volunteering in your community or networking. Enjoy the journey! 
**Sherri will receive her Honorary Diploma in Brockville on Friday, June 7 at the 10 am ceremony.**

It is important to note that if learners do successfully enter the BScN program in semester 5, they will be required to attend classes in person.
Learners must complete a minimum of **five** of the bridging courses before applying to semester 5 of the BScN program through OCAS.
It is important for learners to know that advanced entry admission into the BScN program as a bridging student is going to be **highly** **competitive**. There are limited seats on each campus.
Advanced entry into level 5 of BScN is highly competitive. Applicants will be ranked by their bridging course grades first. Should there be a need to rank applicants further, RPN diploma program grades and prior work experience will be considered.
This number is going to fluctuate per year, per campus. Capacity is based on the availability of clinical placements. We anticipate that the demand for admission to Kingston campus will be greater than for Brockville and Cornwall campuses. So, if you have the ability to attend more than one of the three campuses, we recommend that you keep that in mind while you choose your preferred campus. You will have the opportunity to rank your campuses of choice in order. Do not however, apply to a campus that you have no intention of attending. Once accepted to a campus there will be **no opportunity** to transfer to another campus.
We do have student placements in Ottawa, Trenton, Belleville, and others surrounding our home campus communities, but **we cannot guarantee** the availability of these.

### Artist Statement
The meaning behind images is important to me. Drawing plays a large role in finding meaning. It continues with paintings using colour, brushwork , engaged energy, , movement, commitment to the idea, and importantly the presence of symbolism .All are required to help my search for what is below the surface image.

 _https://www.stlawrencecollege.ca/services/international/immigration/post-graduation-work-permit_

[Top](#top)
## You may be eligible to live and work in Canada after you complete your studies
A post-graduation work permit (PGWP) allows you to remain in Canada and work full time after you complete a certificate, diploma or degree that is at least 8 months in length. You can learn more about PGWP eligibility on the **[IRCC website](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/after-graduation/eligibility.html)**.
How you can apply for a post-graduation work permit (PGWP) depends on where you’re applying from. Most people must apply online for their PGWP. **[Find out how you can apply for your PGWP](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/after-graduation/apply.html)**.    
**Make sure you’re** [**eligible for a PGWP**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/after-graduation/eligibility.html#instructions) **before you apply**. You have 180 days after your school issues your final marks to apply for a PGWP.      
When you apply, make sure you pay the Open work permit holder fee **and** the standard work permit fee.    
**Preparing Your Documents for the PGWP application**        
All you need to apply for a PGWP is:   
* an official letter from your school that confirms you have completed your study program (Confirmation of Program Completion Letter), and    
* an official transcript, or a copy of your transcript from your school’s website. (this can be the Unofficial Transcript from SLC.me).           
**Steps to get required documents:**  
**Step 1:**  You must ensure that you have ‘Applied to Graduate in the SLC.me portal.  If you have not done this already, please do that right away.  This step must be completed for our system to issue documentation to you.  
**Step 2:**  Visit the SLC.me portal and download an unofficial copy of your transcript.  Please double check that all your grades have been posted on the transcript before using it in your application.  
**Step 3:**  You will receive your Confirmation of Program Completion Letter 6 weeks after you complete the last day of your program, at the latest. An electronic copy will be emailed to your SLC student email. This will be sent to you automatically if you have ‘Applied to Graduate’.  
**NOTE:** If your study permit expires within 3 weeks of your program ending, SLC will do its best to process your Letter of Completion urgently.  However, SLC cannot guarantee that these letters will be issued before the 4-6 week timeframe.  If your study permit is expiring close to your program end date, email [**isa@sl.on.ca**](mailto:isa@sl.on.ca) and provide a copy of your study permit, your SLC student ID number and your program. 
You can work full-time while waiting for a decision on your [post-graduation work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/after-graduation.html) application if, at the time you submitted your application, you:    
* had a valid study permit,    
* had completed your program of study,    
* were eligible to [work off-campus](https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/study/study-assess.asp) without a permit, **and**    
* followed the working hour guidelines based on my study permit.   
Generally, no. You must stop working once you’ve received your program completion letter.     
You can continue to work after you finished your studies only if:    
* you’ve already applied for a work permit, or    
* you’re starting a new study program    
You must stop working the day you receive your completion documents. You can continue to work as a student for 20 hours until then. **Starting in Fall 2024, international students in Canada will be permitted to work up to 24 hours per week.** We recommend you get your PGWP application ready, so you can apply the same day you receive it. Once you submit the application, you can work full-time.     
Please check here for **[IRCC application processing times.](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/check-processing-times.html)**   
## **PGWP Workshops**  
We recommend you attend a PGWP Workshop to learn all the rules and processes to apply for your PGWP. You can look for upcoming workshop dates on **[URSLC](https://urslc.sl.on.ca/).**

Privacy Notice
This notice describes how St. Lawrence College collects, uses, and discloses personal information. We adhere to applicable privacy laws, including the _Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act_.
## Collection of Personal Information
St. Lawrence College collects personal information of students, alumni, and other parties, including but not limited to faculty, staff, donors, and private citizens as part of the services our college provides.  Personal information collected by St. Lawrence College includes certain identifying information, including, but not limited to, names, addresses, dates of birth and certain financial information. 
### Consent
Where required, St. Lawrence College obtains the consent of individuals before or when it collects, uses, or discloses personal information. St. Lawrence College may collect, use, or disclose personal information without the knowledge or consent of individuals but only as specified and permitted by law. St. Lawrence College will use reasonable efforts to ensure that an individual is advised of the identified purposes for which personal information will be used or disclosed. Purposes will be stated in a manner that can be reasonably understood by the individual. If St. Lawrence College proposes to use or disclose personal information for a purpose not previously identified, the new purpose will be identified and documented prior to the new use, and where necessary, an individual’s consent will be obtained.
St. Lawrence College will require individuals to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information as a condition of the supply of information or services to the individual only if such collection, use, or disclosure is necessary to provide the information or services. In determining the appropriate form of consent, St. Lawrence College will consider the sensitivity of the personal information and the reasonable expectations of individuals in relation to the purposes for use or disclosure of the information by St. Lawrence College.
### Manner of Collection of Personal Information
St. Lawrence College collects personal information either directly, indirectly or via website technology.
We collect personal information when individuals communicate with us, apply directly to us, or fill out our forms.  We also create records of our dealings with individuals that include personal information.  For example, we create and maintain a student record for every St. Lawrence College student.
St. Lawrence College may also collect personal information from other relevant sources including, without limitation, the Ontario Colleges Application Service, secondary schools, colleges, universities, and other institutions previously attended, including third-party services and test score providers where the items collected form a part of the application or admission process to a college program.
Like many organizations, we collect information about our visitors to our website.  Please refer to our section on “Website Privacy” below.
### Use of Personal Information
Personal information is collected under the legal authority of _The Ontario Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology Act, 2002_, S.O. 2002. This information is used for the academic, administrative, employment-related, financial, statistical, and other appropriate purposes of St. Lawrence College.
Student information collected by St. Lawrence College may be used, among other things, to communicate with, admit, register, and graduate students, record academic achievement, issue identity cards and, where applicable, facilitate local transit passes, to provide access to information technology systems and to operate academic, financial, athletic, recreational, residence, alumni, and other St. Lawrence College programs.
St. Lawrence College may use secure and online platforms to facilitate learning, online assessment and evaluations.   Students will be notified if their webcam, microphone, and computer screen are being monitored and/or viewed by authorized St. Lawrence College employees to ensure the integrity of the learning experience, online assessment, or evaluations.  Students will be informed if they are being recorded, the purpose of the recording and who will have access to the recordings.
Most of the college’s personal information processing happens in Canada, however, if St. Lawrence College has a contract with a third-party service provider that is based in another country, or if a student is participating in a student exchange program, St. Lawrence College may be required to transfer personal data to another country or international organization.  In transferring personal data, St. Lawrence College will employ suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of the personal information so that it is only used in a manner consistent with the individual’s relationship with St. Lawrence College and this Notice.
## Disclosure of Personal Information
### (a) Legitimate Purposes Related to College Functions
Information on admissions, registration and academic achievement may also be disclosed as part of day-to-day operations of St. Lawrence College, used and/or disclosed for statistical and research purposes by St. Lawrence College, where it is necessary and proper in the discharge of St. Lawrence College 's functions, or as required or permitted under law. Information may be shared with other colleges and universities to facilitate a student’s enrolment and participation in a collaborative program in which St. Lawrence College has entered into a partnership agreement.
Information is shared with third parties where processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by St. Lawrence College (e.g. health insurance plan provider, residence management).  To demonstrate that a student has not opted out of a specific student service or program, information confirming their payment of optional term fees may be shared with that respective service provider to ensure the student has unimpeded access to the service or program they have supported.
### (b) Ontario Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities
St. Lawrence College is required to disclose personal information such as Ontario Education Numbers, student characteristics and educational outcomes to the Ministry of Colleges and Universities under s. 15 of the _Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities Act_, R.S.O. 1990, Chapter M.19, as amended.
The ministry collects this data for purposes such as planning, allocating and administering public funding to colleges, universities, and other postsecondary educational and training institutions and to conduct research and analysis, including longitudinal studies, and statistical activities conducted by or on behalf of the ministry for purposes that relate to postsecondary education and training. Further information on how the Ministry of Colleges and Universities uses this personal information is available on the ministry’s website.
Further information on the collection and use of student-level enrolment-related data can be obtained from the **[Ministry of Colleges and Universities](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ministry-colleges-universities)** website.
### (c) Quality Assurance Agencies
Samples of student work will be made available to subject matter experts periodically in accordance with the Ministry of Colleges and Universities requirements for quality assurance purposes. All names and other identifying information will be removed from the work.
### (d) Statistics Canada
Under the authority of section 13 of the _Statistics Act_ (Canada), Statistics Canada requires Ontario colleges and universities to report student-level data to Statistics Canada’s Postsecondary Student Information System (PSIS) to meet policy and planning needs in the field of postsecondary education. The information collected may be used by Statistics Canada for statistical and research purposes, and the confidentiality provisions of the Statistics Act prevent the information from being released in any way that would identify a student. Further information is available on the Statistics Canada’s [**Postsecondary Student Information System**](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/survey/business/5017).
### (e) St. Lawrence College Student Email Addresses: 
St. Lawrence College acknowledges that student assigned email addresses may be visible to other students when participating in St. Lawrence College’s collaboration platforms (such as Office 365). Since students participate with other students via course level collaboration platforms (such as Blackboard or MS Teams) to fulfill course requirements, students should expect to share this limited information as part of their participation in educational activities. 
Students can opt-out of participation in optional collaboration platforms (such as URSLC). 
St. Lawrence College publishes student assigned email addresses in the college global address list to facilitate communication.   
## Access and Correction
Individuals have the right to ask for their own personal information and to request a correction of records containing their own personal information. For more information, please visit the **[Freedom of Information](https://www.stlawrencecollege.ca/about/fippa)** webpage.  
## Storage and Retention of Personal Information
St. Lawrence College takes reasonable steps to protect personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification, regardless of the format in which the information is held, using appropriate administrative and security safeguards. In working with service providers who handle personal information on its behalf, St. Lawrence College takes reasonable steps to choose service providers that can protect personal information as per St. Lawrence College security and privacy standards. Service provider privacy and security obligations are documented in contractual agreements.
Record retention is dependent on the type of record. Records are retained as per department/program retention practices, and/or as required by legislated statute.

## Career Opportunities
Registered Nurses find rewarding careers in areas such as public and community health, critical care, rehabilitation, long-term care, maternal and child health, medical and surgical nursing, mental health, correctional services, and many more.
Many graduates embark on exciting careers upon graduation, while others pursue further education. It is not uncommon for our graduates to obtain a graduate certificate, a Master’s degree, or a Doctoral degree. Students who wish to pursue graduate studies are encouraged to check the specific admission requirements of the granting body or learning institution they are interested in attending after St. Lawrence College.
## Testimonials
"I wouldn't have been able to get to where I am now without the knowledge and experience that I gained through the Nursing Program at SLC. So many people at the college helped me to become what I needed and wanted—and for that I give thanks everyday."
"What I really enjoyed about the collaborative nursing program at the college was the learning environment. Classroom sizes were kept small, which allowed for students to develop confidence amongst their peers, whether it be through open discussion in providing insight into difficult ethical topics or learning clinical skills in the lab with an almost one-to-one approach."
Andrew Bissonnette
"I always felt right at home throughout my four years at St. Lawrence College. The small community atmosphere had a very positive impact on my education."
Leslie Beveridge

## artist Bio
#### Program of Completion: Fine Arts Certificate, 2019
Retired and discovering (seeing) there is so much more to learn about art, people, and nature. The full “stop” of this pandemic, ironically, is a deeper struggle for connection and understanding of the things we all took for granted. NOW is all we really have. Keeping strong. 
Contact Info: **[gawidz@gmail.com](mailto:gawidz@gmail.com%20)** 
#### About the Artwork
**Keeping Close to Home**  
Acrylic over pastels 
35 ½” x 23 ½” 
$200 
During the Covid Lockdown art supplies were deemed non-essential. Just as some birds are known to recycle nests, this piece was created on an upcycled canvas with discarded, hardening paint applied with hard-edged sticks, bits of grass, twigs, and hair. I am pleased by the results. 
**Mustang Mid-wives Encourage Labour**  
Acrylic over pastel 
36” x 48” 
$200.00 
Inspiration was difficult during lockdown. This piece started as a mustang rolling in the dust beside a gravel road, based on an old photo I had taken years ago in the Yukon. I returned to the painting this year, as the canvas demanded more “presence of beings”, and added eight lively, lovely, encouraging young wild things, transforming the scene into a baby party! 
**First Steps of Wonder**  
Acrylic 
23 ½” x 35 ½” 
$150 
Time, under the almost two years of lockdown and enforced “bubble” of isolation, did not slow down mother or dad or nature. Two foals in two years, and this from the same mare and sire…life continues!!!

### Zachary Leger
I had initially gone to St. Lawrence College Open House for Game Development; I was asked by some of the student volunteers if I was interested in going on a tour, to which I accepted out of curiosity. After touring the labs and the St. Lawrence River Institute of Environmental Sciences, I decided to change my focus to the environmental field and applied for the Environmental Technician program then and there.
The best thing about the Environmental Technician program is the affiliation with the River Institute which grants the program fantastic facilities, field excursions, experience, contact with people in the field, and great teachers. The program provides diverse career path options and smaller class sizes mean more face time with the teachers and educators.
The Environmental Technician program greatly improved upon my existing knowledge, giving me skills such as well design, environmental sampling techniques, field experience, and more. I also gained invaluable contacts in the environmental field which allowed me to get in contact with my current employer.
My current job title is Junior Environmental Technologist at Malroz Engineering. Our facilities are located in Kingston, in the heart of downtown. While in the field, my duties include assisting senior field staff with groundwater and surface water monitoring, installation and maintenance of monitoring wells, conducting small scale Designated Substance Surveys (DSS), and conducting site observations on various long‐term projects. These projects may be local, or as far afield as the Greater Toronto Area or even Sudbury. My office duties include treatment and validation of our field data, AutoCAD and other computer assisted data presentation programs, sample handling, and assisting project managers with report redaction and Environmental Site Assessments (ESAs).
### Louis Savard
Having recently lost employment due to organization closure, I was faced with a tough decision: look for another job or look for a career.  The choice became easy with the support of my wife and my previous desire to work in the environmental sciences field.  After qualifying for the Second Career program of the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities, the next big decision was which institution to choose.  After many contacts, visits and discussions, St. Lawrence College (SLC) ended on top of my list.
In hindsight, I should never have had any doubts as to which College to choose.  The Cornwall campus of SLC is a natural fit for any program in the environmental field.  From its location by the majestic St. Lawrence River to its affiliation with the St. Lawrence River Institute of Environmental Sciences (SLRIES) and the overall support provided both at the ground level by the professors and higher up by the program coordinator all the way to the Dean’s office, SLC provided me with an education and experience that has helped me secure not only employment in my field but my career of choice.  Was is tough? Yes. Was it worth it? ABSOLUTELY.
But you need to go out west to work in the environmental field you say? I beg to differ! Immediately in my first semester of studies I identified SLRIES as the organization I wanted to secure employment with.  I started as a volunteer and made use of the little free time I had to utilize the facilities that SLRIES offered.  I then did my work placement with SLRIES and worked on fundamental research projects lead by SLRIES researchers.  I was hooked.  I am now in my third year of employment with SLRIES as the Project Development Technician of the Applied Research and Technical Services division and loving every minute of it.  If you’re focused and persistent, all the tools provided by SLC nearly always guarantees employment in your field and in most cases, with the organization and geographical location you want!
Thank you SLC for the great education and experience, you have an ambassador for life and an alumni that is proud of where he came from.
### Andrew Couturier
**Why did you choose the SLC Environmental Technician Program?** 
I chose the SLC Enviro Tech program because I liked the concept of working right next to the river (as well as sometimes on the river), with PhD level professors who actively work in their field of interest. This provided many opportunities I would not usually expect from an education setting, such as working in a boat on the river, or digging a well in the school parking lot.
**What are the best 3 things about SLC?** 
Professors are accessible and willing to help Student success is prevalent and easy to access School is large enough to be an Ontario education competitor, but not too large that it begins to feel like a university.
**What are the best 3 things about the Environmental Technician program?** 
Working outdoors, performing real tests and real work. 
Working with professionals, assisting them in real world work 
Access to the OIT & ELDWO programs.
**If you could give an incoming Environmental Technician student some advice, what would it be?** 
Get involved with all the extra opportunities. The River Institute is always looking for help with their research, and there are opportunities to work with surrounding companies.
**Describe your current job (title, place of employment, city) and tell us a bit about your role** 
I am currently a Warehouse Supervisor, Jr. Compliance Officer and Health & Safety Representative for EDI Inc, in Ottawa, ON. (Electronic Distributors International). I manage all warehouse operations for an electronics waste disposal company with an approximate annual disposal weight of 2.5 million pounds. I also ensure facility and worker safety, and ensure legal and certification compliance.
**How did the Environmental Technician program prepare you for your career? 
**Technical Writing was a large factor. I rose to my position by demonstrating I was competent by writing an 18 page operations audit. Since then, I have also written a 26 page compliance audit, and a 20+ page ECA Annual Report.

## Overview
This graduate certificate program allows registered nurses (RNs) to expand their role to include prescribing of medications. In 2023, the Ontario government announced they would allow registered nurses to prescribe medications, after meeting specific requirements, for certain conditions such as contraception, immunizations, smoking cessation, and topical wound care in a variety of settings including long-term care homes and retirement homes. 
In consultation with stakeholders and using evidence from other jurisdictions to align with legislation, the Registered Nurse – Prescribing program was developed to meet the needs of Ontarians in a safe, efficient way.
SLC is delivering this training through its SLC+ Continuing Education online platform. Applicants must be RNs with current registration with the College of Nurses of Ontario (CNO) without restrictions, with two years of full-time experience (or equivalent).
* Open to domestic applicants only. This program is not available for international students. 
* Each theory course is delivered in an online asynchronous (work at your own pace) format and must be completed in the first two terms of the program. 
* Students will have one calendar year to complete the two theory courses and one clinical practicum course.
SLC is part of a consortium of six Ontario colleges delivering this program across Southeastern and Northwestern Ontario. Indigenous and bilingual ways of knowing and learning were considered in the development of the program to ensure that the needs of all communities served can be met. The online program delivery model ensures access for nurses across all of Ontario and learners are encouraged to register for their program with the college that is in closest proximity to their preferred clinical placement location.

We're here to help your student
## WELCOME TO THE SLC FAMILY
Choosing the right education is a big decision. We've created this guide for SLC parents & student supporters to help during this exciting transition.

## RESOURCES
At SLC we offer multiple services and resources focusing on student success. We want students to feel welcomed and supported throughout their journey at SLC. 
## Common Scenarios
Your student might contact you if they are feeling overwhelmed and stressed. We're here to help! We've put together a list of common scenarios and steps that you can take to support them.
It’s October and your student who had an 85% average in Highschool returns from classes one day and tells you they failed an exam. They express how that several their courses do not interest them and that they are beginning to question their program choice. The student is starting to feel panicked and lose their motivation
**Issues in this Scenario:**
* Shifting gears from high school and adjusting to the demands of college studies
* Concerns about academic success
* Learning appropriate skills
* Establishing an educational direction
**How You Can Help:**
* Realize that the demands of university academic are very different from those of high school. Have reasonable expectations. A significant drop in grades compared to high school is common, and an “F” in one exam or even a course does not signal an inappropriate program choice
* Encourage your student to access the various academic supports on campus and to take part in study groups with other students, and to visit professors and instructors during their office hours if they need assistance or clarification.
* If your student lives at home, help them to set up a suitable study space.
**Supports at St. Lawrence College:**
* Academic Support Centre
* Student Success Facilitators
Your student lives in residence on campus away from home. During a visit home you notice that they seem unusually quiet and withdrawn. When you ask, they initially deny that there’s any problem but later admit that they’re missing their family and old friends and are having trouble establishing new relationships. Indeed, they tell you that they’re feeling insignificant and out of place and that they’re worried about being able to fit in.
**Issues in this Scenario:**
* Separating from familiar people and places
* Adjusting to a new environment
* Developing an identity on campus
* Establishing new social support systems
**How you can Help:** 
* Be available and willing to listen. Be prepared for mixed emotions, especially during the first few weeks. Pay attention to your student’s feelings and try not to trivialize their concerns, e.g., “But, these are the best years of your life!”
* If your student is living away from home, avoid asking whether they’re homesick. If they are (even just a little) being reminded of it can make things worse. Use phone calls, e-mails, text messages, Facetime/Skype, social media, and letters (in moderation) to stay in touch (even if they don’t respond immediately). Visit (but not too often). Send pictures and “care packages” of some of their favourite things. Most students - even the most seemingly fiercely independent - need the security of family ties.
**Supports at St. Lawrence College**
* URSLC (Events)
* Student Government (Events)
* Accessibility and Counselling
You know that mid-term examinations are approaching, and assignments are due. Your student seems unusually tired and anxious. You overhear them telling a friend that they’re feeling overwhelmed and stressed out. They indicate that they just can’t seem to get a handle on the system and to manage the workload along with everything else that’s expected of them. They’re wondering whether they have what it takes to succeed at College. 
**Issues in the Scenario:**
* Adjusting to college culture including changes in academic demands, structures, and responsibilities
* Understanding academic and administrative policies and procedures
* Managing greater freedom and flexibility in combination with independent learning and increased personal responsibility
* Learning time-management skills
**How you can help:**
* Encourage your student to familiarize themselves with the college’s academic policies and procedures. Become aware of them yourself. They are outlined in St. Lawrence College’s Academic Policies webpage. Having knowledge ahead of time can prevent poor decision-making later and it is the expectation of the college that students acquaint themselves with this information.
* Resist the urge to “rescue” or “fix it” as doing this will deprive your student of the opportunity to develop their own problem solving skills, resources and resilience. Rather, offer suggestions or direct them to campus services.
* Recognize that, unlike high school, the university lifestyle often requires students to be on campus beyond the “9 to 5” routine. They may have classes or labs that start as early as 8 a.m. or end after 9 p.m. As well, group and, particularly, studio work often take place in the evening or on weekends, sometimes extending into the early morning hours.
* Remind your student of the role of “the three R’s” when it comes to self-care and stress management - Relaxation, Recreation, and Relationships. All of these helps to create a balanced lifestyle and to recharge one’s mental, emotional and physical batteries.

Your student is living off campus in a shared apartment. While they received some government financial assistance, it was a lower amount than anticipated. You agreed to pay tuition fees with the understanding your student would be responsible for other expenses. They saved some money from summer employment but are not currently working in order to focus on their studies. It is now November, and you receive an email indicating they are low on cash and asking for a money transfer to pay next month’s rent.
**Issues in this Scenario:**
* Learning to manage financial resources
* If living away from home, adjusting to a more restrictive budget and greater financial independence
**How you can help:** 
* Talk about money matters before school starts. Help your student draw up a realistic budget and discuss with them a financial plan that will ensure sufficient resources to cover expenses. Revisit the budget created at mid-year and year’s end. Address the responsibilities and consequences associated with using credit cards.
* Work with your student to develop strategies for resisting overspending and for ensuring that they have savings should an emergency arise.
* Discuss the impact of working part-time on their studies. It is generally not advisable for students carrying a full course load (five to six courses), particularly those just beginning university, to work more than 12 - 15 hours a week. In cases where it is necessary for your student to work more than this, explore the possibility of a reduced course load.
* Be clear and open about the amount of financial support you are able to offer and for what purposes (e.g. tuition, books and supplies, rent).

3. Classes begin on the day after Labour Day. As classes progress, first-year students often realize that they need to learn how to handle new academic responsibilities (e.g., meeting deadlines, reading several chapters in one week). At the same time, many will understandably want to participate in social activities such as campus clubs and organizations. In some cases, misgivings about program suitability might arise as early as the first few weeks of classes.

During this month students face two major issues. The first is the challenge of meeting the requirements of their coursework. Term papers, mid-term exams, presentations, and group projects are often due by the middle to the end of the month. Quite naturally, your student will feel rather stressed. The second involves students’ recognition that their lifestyle has changed within a short period of time. This is especially evident around the Thanksgiving long weekend. Those who go home may be unable to partake in all holiday activities. They may have to study or have a lot of reading to do. Some may discover that they cannot wait to get back to university, while others may find it hard to return.

* Refreshments & more!
Grades for coursework such as mid-term exams and major assignments tend to come in at this time. Students’ academic performance can decrease by a letter grade if not more, and for some, worry about disappointing important people in their lives may develop. Students begin to gear up for final exams. Although some will be feeling comfortable with their student role on campus, others will be wondering if they fit in. Financial concerns may arise as students find that their summer earnings or first-semester loans are starting to run out. Your student may also face issues regarding their roommate or living situation.
* Last Day of Classes for most programs
* Christmas Break Commences: College Closed
Fall semester classes end this month and final exams are written, some of them in large lecture halls and/or gymnasiums. Some students study all night and develop poor sleep hygiene. Staying late on campus and joining or creating study groups is not uncommon. Some out-of-town students may eagerly await the return home for the winter break. Others may find it difficult to adjust to changing dynamics in relationships with old friends and family members. During the break, they may continue to keep to their atypical schedules and may resist attempts to enforce previous sleeping habits and curfews. Final grades and academic standing will be posted
* Christmas Break Continues: College Closed

* **For new Winter students only:** January 1 to 31 by 4:00pm
While students who have adjusted to the college system are likely to return to class feeling confident, others may experience the post-break blues after leaving home again. Those contemplating transferring programs or schools will need to investigate application deadlines as they can arise in the next couple of weeks or months. Reconnecting with friends on campus and accessing the appropriate student supports can help your student ease back into the academic routine.
* Family Day: February 21 - NO Classes and College is closed
* BScN & BBA Spring Break
The search for summer employment often begins now. As well, students living away from their family home may start to consider living accommodations for next year. Stressors associated with intimate relationships may arise. For some, these matters may be sources of anxiety and preoccupation. Reading week occurs this month. This time may be used to catch up on readings, do term papers, prepare presentations, work on group projects, or study for mid-term examinations scheduled for after the return to classes.

**Winter Break Week**
Winter Break is taking place from Monday, March 7 to Friday, March 11.
As the winter term moves into its final stages, the stress will most likely increase for your student. Based on the results of their assignments and mid-term examinations, some students may contemplate dropping winter semester courses. Typically, final drop deadlines for winter courses occur toward the end of this month. Additionally, students may face uncertainties related to upcoming course intentions for the next academic year. Your student will likely be preparing for their final exams but may feel more comfortable because they have experienced this before.
* Easter Holidays: Good Friday - NO Classes
* Last Day of Classes for most programs
Winter term classes end. Final assignments will be due and final exams will take place. Some students who have lived away from their families during the academic year will be excited to return home. Others may feel anxious about separating from new friends made at St. Lawrence College. Students may attempt to orchestrate their move back home for the summer while simultaneously preparing for and writing final exams. Some may register for summer courses. Those who have not already secured summer employment may feel pressured to find it. The stress students experience at this time of year can be reflected in cramming, not sleeping well, and having poor eating habits.

## Care package ideas
The Student Engagement team came up with great ideas on how you can help your student with this big transition. You can send them care packages to celebrate a special occasion or just to let them know that you're always thinking of them. 
Put together a care package that will make the student feel warm and toasty despite the chilled temperatures. A great winter care package could include:
* A mug
* Hot chocolate or tea
* Instant gourmet coffee
* Bag of mini marshmallows
* Chocolate covered spoons
* Wool blanket
* Slippers
* Fleece pyjamas bottoms, or long johns
* Instant soup
Toiletries can be very expensive on a college campus - especially if your student is attending college in a smaller town that doesn't have a bigger department store. In addition, your college student might not have the time to shop or the money to buy personal items. Items you'll want to consider including are:
* Plastic flip-flops for the showers
* Wrap towels so it's easy to cover up to and from showers
* Shampoo, conditioner, shaving cream, and lotion
* Razors
* Deodorant
* Lightly scented body spray or cologne
* Loofah
* Nail clippers
* Hair gel, hair spray or other styling products
If your student gets sick or injured, they may not have the time or means to go to the drugstore to pick up some items. You can make this package and send it right at the beginning of the semester, so they’ll be prepared. They will appreciate having these things on hand if they need them. Consider some of these items:
* Vitamins
* Over-the-counter pain medication such as ibuprofen
* Anti-bacterial hand gel
* Band-Aids®
* Polysporin
* General cold medicine like DayQuil
* Tissues
* Hot tea bags
If your student is celebrating their birthday while they are away, make the student feel loved with a fun, birthday-in-a-box care package.
* Microwave cake/Mug Cake
* Streamers or a birthday banner
* Birthday hats
* A party noisemaker
* Favourite snacks
Do you want to let your college student know that you support them in their educational goals? Try sending a package that specifically focuses on studying. Consider including:
* Bookmarks
* Highlighters
* Pens and pencils
* Handheld pencil sharpener
* Sticky notes
* Paper clips
* Stress ball

## Program Outline
### 2024-2025
This course covers key concepts in atomic structure, chemical bonding, nomenclature, chemical reactions, and quantities in chemical reactions. Data collection, data analysis and laboratory techniques will be covered in the laboratory component of the course.
As the first mathematics course for Pre-Health students, the content covers numeracy, percentages, proportions, conversions, and dosages using mental math. Fundamental algebra, linear functions and linear systems of equations, 2D and 3D geometry, and exponential and logarithmic functions are also explored. All concepts have a health care focus and include real world applications to the health sciences. 
This course enables the learner to develop a foundation in the fundamental concepts and applications of Biological Sciences. The learner studies and explores fundamental principles of cellular organization, structure and function as they relate to metabolism, interaction with its external environment, growth, disorders, cellular reproduction, inheritance, and the basis of microbes and infectious diseases. This course enables the learner to examine these concepts with a systemic approach to the study of the human body.
This course is designed to help students develop and practice the communication skills needed to succeed in college and workforce environments. Emphasis is placed on improving foundational communication strategies-reading, writing, listening, and speaking—and on developing research and critical thinking skills. 
Students apply critical thinking and problem-solving techniques to physics concepts related to the health science field. Concepts studied include kinematics, forces, work, energy and power, thermodynamics, fluids and pressure, nuclear physics, electrostatics, magnetism, waves and electromagnetic radiation.
Students explore trends, current and emerging technologies, careers, and the societal impact of the ever-changing healthcare field, in a seminar format. Students will benefit from hands-on experiences and discussions with industry experts from a variety of health-related fields. The course emphasizes the variable nature of healthcare in a connected world.
This course builds on the concepts developed in CHEM103 with emphasis on energy changes and rates of reactions, chemical systems and equilibrium, acids and bases, stoichiometric calculations, and oxidation-reduction reactions. Nomenclature and reactions of organic compounds including selected biomolecules are covered. An emphasis is placed on applications of these topics in health care and environmental issues. Data collection, data analysis, laboratory techniques, and report writing are covered in the laboratory component of the course.
Prerequisite(s): CHEM 103
This second level biology course builds upon the concepts introduced in BIOL 110. The course uses a systems approach to the study of the biological structures and physiological functions of the human body. Organ systems of the human body are explored with an introduction to common pathologies with examples taken from current scientific research.
Prerequisite(s): BIOL 110
Students develop skills as writers and researchers in professional areas. Students apply critical thinking and analysis skills to assess, interpret, and extrapolate evidence as they explore issues in their professional areas. Emphasis is placed on the analysis and evaluation of issues within professional literature and communication with a variety of audiences.
This course introduces statistical terminology and diverse methods used in describing, analyzing, and interpreting health sciences data in a variety of formats. Empirical and theoretical probability and inferential statistics will be explored using numerical methods and statistical software

## Testimonials
"All the classes I took in Pre-Health are helping me in the BScN program today. Classes like communications helped me develop my writing, reading and researching skills, which have been a real asset to me because I use them a lot in nursing. Classes such as chemistry and biology prepared me for nursing classes such as anatomy and physiology. "
"As a mature student, Pre-Health Sciences was integral to my successful career change. The curriculum provided an excellent educational foundation and facilitated my acceptance into the BScN program at St. Lawrence College. The professors were welcoming, helpful and extremely professional. "
Kimberly Ann MacEachern
"Students were provided with tools to help them realize success in the form of peer tutoring, math and writing centre help, and on-on-one sessions with course instructors. Thanks to my time in the Pre-Health program, I entered the nursing program with a strong background, a familiarity with course expectations, and an established group of friends. "

With Pride Month wrapping up shortly, please remember that we can learn more, be an ally, and support the creativity, perspectives, and work of 2SLGBTQ+ community members all year round. The following lists books written by, for, or about Pride topics, and can make great additions to a summer reading list, or as gifts.   
**Children’s and Young Adult books**  
The **[Children’s Book Council](https://www.cbcbooks.org/cbc-book-lists/books-full-of-pride-2022/)** is a nonprofit trade association of children’s book publishers in North America, dedicated to supporting the industry and promoting children’s books and reading. Their **[“Books Full of Pride”](https://www.cbcbooks.org/2024/06/04/pride-month/)** lists include fiction and non-fiction for children and young adults by authors from across North America.   
  The **[Canadian Pride Historical Society](https://cphs.ca/)** is a non-profit organization on a mission to document and record the history of the Pride Movement in Canada and to educate all Canadians on the impact the Pride Movement has had on our gender, sexual, and relationship diverse community. Their website includes a  **[book list](https://cphs.ca/pride-books-for-students/)** for elementary and secondary school-aged children.
  **Non-Fiction and Fiction books**
CBC has several annual programs and events in support of reading, and their website includes curated lists of books on Pride topics from Canadian authors. See lists from prior years **[here](https://www.cbc.ca/books/25-canadian-books-to-read-for-pride-month-1.6875891)**.   
  The **[Booker Prize](https://thebookerprizes.com/the-booker-prize)** is an international award granted to a single work of fiction a panel of judges feel is the best work of fiction written in English and published in the United Kingdom or Ireland. Their website indicates that in recent years, the Prize has often been awarded to novels whose central characters are lesbian, gay, bisexual or non-binary. The organization does confirm that it is a coincidence some recent winning novels include queer characters, but they say, “...it also reflects a welcome burgeoning visibility of LGBTQ+ experiences in new fiction.” They have a **[recommended list](https://thebookerprizes.com/the-booker-library/features/12-of-the-best-novels-for-pride-month-from-the-booker-library)** of some of the best works (fiction) in their view that support a diverse range of voices and experiences.

**What is a Co-op, Placement, or Internship?** 
In Canada, some programs may include mandatory work experience as part of their curriculum and program requirements. The purpose of this is to give students practical on-the-job experiences that prepare you for the job market after you complete your program. These are referred to as a Co-Op’s, Internships, and Placements.  
Generally, you will need to complete a certain number of hours to meet your placement requirements. If a placement is required in your program, it is best to talk to the Program Coordinator, or Placement Coordinator to find out more. 
**What is a Co-Op Work Permit?** 
A [**Co-Op Work Permit**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/intern.html) is a type of work permit that is required for international students who have a co-op, placement, or internship as a mandatory requirement of their program. 
A Co-Op Work Permit is required when your co-op, placement, or internship will exceed beyond the 20 hours of work students are permitted to do during their studies. Co-op Work Permits may not be required for all placements depending on the number of hours. If you are unsure, check with the international office. 
You may apply for a co-op or intern work permit if: 
* you have a valid study permit 
* working is required to complete your study program in Canada 
* you have a letter from your [**school**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare/designated-learning-institutions-list.html) that confirms all students in your program need to complete work placements to get their degree 
* your co-op or internship is 50% or less of the total program of study 
**_You may have received a Co-op Work Permit when you entered Canada. Please check if you did before submitting an application._** 
**_How do I get a Co-Op Work Permit?_** 
In most cases, a Co-Op Work Permit will be required before you begin your placement. We recommend applying for a Co-Op Work Permit at least 3-4 months before you begin your placement. Attend an [_**Immigration Workshops**_](https://www.stlawrencecollege.ca/services/international/immigration/immigration-permit-workshops) with our International Student Advisors to learn more. 
**Receive Your Co-Op Work Permit Upon Entry To Canada** 
In your Letter of Acceptance package, you will receive a letter regarding your co-op work permit information. We recommend you show this letter to the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) officer when you are first entering Canada. The CBSA officer can issue your Co-op Work Permit at the same time as your Study Permit. 
**Apply Online** 
For more support and information on how to apply for a Co-op Work Permit, visit **[the Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada website](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/intern.html)**.

St. Lawrence College will use reasonable efforts to ensure that an individual is advised of the identified purposes for which personal information will be used or disclosed. Purposes will be stated in a manner that can be reasonably understood by the individual.

St. Lawrence College may also collect personal information from other relevant sources including, without limitation, the Ontario Colleges Application Service, secondary schools, colleges, universities, and other institutions previously attended, including third-party services and test score providers where the items collected form a part of the application or admission process to a college program.

Information is shared with third parties where processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by St. Lawrence College (e.g. health insurance plan provider, residence management).  To demonstrate that a student has not opted out of a specific student service or program, information confirming their payment of optional term fees may be shared with that respective service provider to ensure the student has unimpeded access to the service or program they have supported.
### (b) Ontario Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities
St. Lawrence College is required to disclose personal information such as Ontario Education Numbers, student characteristics and educational outcomes to the Ministry of Colleges and Universities under s. 15 of the _Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities Act_, R.S.O. 1990, Chapter M.19, as amended.
The ministry collects this data for purposes such as planning, allocating and administering public funding to colleges, universities, and other postsecondary educational and training institutions and to conduct research and analysis, including longitudinal studies, and statistical activities conducted by or on behalf of the ministry for purposes that relate to postsecondary education and training. Further information on how the Ministry of Colleges and Universities uses this personal information is available on the ministry’s website.
Further information on the collection and use of student-level enrolment-related data can be obtained from the **[Ministry of Colleges and Universities](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ministry-colleges-universities)** website.
### (c) Quality Assurance Agencies
Samples of student work will be made available to subject matter experts periodically in accordance with the Ministry of Colleges and Universities requirements for quality assurance purposes. All names and other identifying information will be removed from the work.
### (d) Statistics Canada
Under the authority of section 13 of the _Statistics Act_ (Canada), Statistics Canada requires Ontario colleges and universities to report student-level data to Statistics Canada’s Postsecondary Student Information System (PSIS) to meet policy and planning needs in the field of postsecondary education. The information collected may be used by Statistics Canada for statistical and research purposes, and the confidentiality provisions of the Statistics Act prevent the information from being released in any way that would identify a student. Further information is available on the Statistics Canada’s [**Postsecondary Student Information System**](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/survey/business/5017).
### (e) St. Lawrence College Student Email Addresses: 
St. Lawrence College acknowledges that student assigned email addresses may be visible to other students when participating in St. Lawrence College’s collaboration platforms (such as Office 365). Since students participate with other students via course level collaboration platforms (such as Blackboard or MS Teams) to fulfill course requirements, students should expect to share this limited information as part of their participation in educational activities. 
Students can opt-out of participation in optional collaboration platforms (such as URSLC). 
St. Lawrence College publishes student assigned email addresses in the college global address list to facilitate communication.

## **OVERVIEW**
The Career/College Preparatory Program is designed to provide adult learners with the opportunity to improve academic, technical, personal, and interpersonal skills in preparation for college programs, apprenticeships, and future employment.
College Prep may be for those who are missing admission requirements to the college program of their choice. Our ACE courses (Academic and Career Entrance) are recognized as equivalent to Grade 12C by Ontario Colleges (except biology which is Grade 11C) and for the purpose of admission to college or apprenticeship programs. College Prep is also an option for those who technically meet the admission requirements but want to improve their academic skills or boost self-confidence before entering a fulltime college program. College Prep is also appropriate for those who are looking for work or for those who already have a job but want to advance at their workplace.
This Employment Ontario program is funded by the Ontario Government.
## **FAQs**
Who can take Career/College Prep?
Canadian citizens and permanent residents with valid Social Insurance Numbers, 18 years of age or older who have a mailing address within 50km of their chosen campus and are proficient in English (speaking, listening, reading, and writing). You do not require a high school diploma to register.
How much does it cost?
College Prep is free for those who meet the eligibility requirements.
What are the classes like?
In College Prep students receive the course material and work through it at their own pace, supported by College Prep faculty who will answer questions and provide clarification. For each of the core subject areas (math, English, biology, and chemistry), instructors are available during in-class time for one-to-one instruction. We currently only offer College level high school credits, not University level.
How often do students attend College Prep classes?
Students are required to attend classes for a minimum of three hours per week. Students themselves determine when they will attend College Prep classes. We offer day and evening sessions so that each student can design his or her own schedule to fit their personal needs. 
When does the College Prep program start?
College Prep is a continuous intake, so students don’t have to wait for certain times of the year to sign up and can start anytime. 
How long does the program last?
Since College Prep is self-paced, the time students take to finish a subject will vary depending on how quickly students grasp the material, how much time they can devote to their studies, and how motivated they are. On average, it takes students three to five months (12-20 weeks) to complete one subject. You only take the courses you are interested in.

**In Memory of Louise Porter, May 26, 1951 to December 18, 2008**
This bursary was setup in honour of Louise Porter and is used to support student bursaries at St. Lawrence College. Louise was admired for her strength and courage as a single mother of two boys, who returned to school later in life to attend the St. Lawrence College Hairstylist Program. She will always be remembered for her generosity. Louise was well known to be a hard worker, and like her, we will continue to work hard to raise money to support more students in financial need with this bursary. Thank you for helping us continue to build upon this great cause!
**Louise Porter Memorial Bursary**
Available to a single mother entering any full-time program at St. Lawrence College Kingston campus. Applicants must be returning to school to further their education following an absence of two or more years from formal education and should outline their personal goals within their application for this award. Must be an Ontario resident and demonstrate financial need.

## Overview
The Career/College Preparatory Program is designed to provide adult learners with the opportunity to improve academic, technical, personal, and interpersonal skills in preparation for college programs, apprenticeships, and future employment.
College Prep may be for those who are missing admission requirements to the college program of their choice. Our ACE courses (Academic and Career Entrance) are recognized as equivalent to Grade 12C by Ontario Colleges (except biology which is Grade 11C) and for the purpose of admission to college or apprenticeship programs. College Prep is also an option for those who technically meet the admission requirements but want to improve their academic skills or boost self-confidence before entering a fulltime college program. College Prep is also appropriate for those who are looking for work or for those who already have a job but want to advance at their workplace.
This Employment Ontario program is funded by the Ontario Government.
**FAQs (in drop down button style)**
**Q: Who can take Career/College Prep?**
Canadian citizens and permanent residents with valid Social Insurance Numbers, 18 years of age or older who have a mailing address within 50km of their chosen campus and are proficient in English (speaking, listening, reading, and writing). You do not require a high school diploma to register.
**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: College Prep is free for those who meet the eligibility requirements.
**Q: What are the classes like?**
A: In College Prep students receive the course material and work through it at their own pace, supported by College Prep faculty who will answer questions and provide clarification. For each of the core subject areas (math, English, biology, and chemistry), instructors are available during in-class time for one-to-one instruction. We currently only offer College level high school credits, not University level.
**Q: How often do students attend College Prep classes?**
A: Students are required to attend classes for a minimum of three hours per week. Students themselves determine when they will attend College Prep classes. We offer day and evening sessions so that each student can design his or her own schedule to fit their personal needs.
**Q: When does the College Prep program start?**
A: College Prep is a continuous intake, so students don’t have to wait for certain times of the year to sign up and can start anytime.
**Q: How long does the program last?**
A: Since College Prep is self-paced, the time students take to finish a subject will vary depending on how quickly students grasp the material, how much time they can devote to their studies, and how motivated they are. On average, it takes students three to five months (12-20 weeks) to complete one subject. You only take the courses you are interested in.

Students develop safe handling skills and learn how to perform physical examinations and treatments. The students operate the SLC "Scruffy Dog Salon” where they groom dogs under the supervision of experienced groomers. Lab time is also spent learning surgical sup­port techniques and basic clinical laboratory procedures which aid in the diagnosis and treatment of disease in domestic animals.
The program is structured around four areas:
* Animal Diseases, Care and Restraint, and Grooming
* Laboratory and Surgical Support Preparation and Maintenance
* Front Office Management and Marketing
* Support Studies
Students learn about animal health and disease, behaviour, handling and general care (involving cats, dogs, exotic pets, wildlife and livestock), dog grooming, and basic laboratory procedures. Students also study computer operations and office procedures, and they practice communication and mar­keting techniques.
The skills graduates bring to their place of employment will help to increase both the quality and scope of the services provided to animals and their owners.

## Overview
The Community Integration through Co-operative Education (CICE) program is an academic based program. It is a two-year certificate program designed for adults with developmental disabilities, intellectual disabilities, acquired brain injuries or other significant learning challenges who wish to further their education/vocational training in a community college setting.
CICE students will have the opportunity to complete an individualized CICE program of study including courses from a minimum of two or more areas of concentration selected from St. Lawrence College’s program offerings. Each semester, students will take 5 courses, each 3-4 hours in length. A Learning Specialist attends elective classes with students to support their academic needs. Elective course choices may depend on seat availability and program suitability. 
Coursework will provide CICE students with opportunities to develop and enhance their academic skills.

"In the CICE Program the students are accepted as students, not because they need the extra help. They are seen in the eyes of truly amazing staff as spectacular individuals, and those staff members help bring the strengths to the surface."

Students will learn the foundations of teamwork as a component of successful business operations. The functional areas of business and their relationship to management, leadership, and the future of work are discussed.
This course is designed to help students develop and practice the communication skills needed to succeed in college and workforce environments. Emphasis is placed on improving foundational communication strategies-reading, writing, listening, and speaking—and on developing research and critical thinking skills. 
This course is designed to familiarize the student with basic computer operations and applications through instructor-led exercises, activities, and case studies. It explores various concepts of effective computer usage with a hands-on introduction to the Windows operating system, file management, and working effectively and collaboratively in an online environment. It also provides in-depth exploration and application of various features of the current version of Microsoft Office software including Word, PowerPoint, and Microsoft Teams. Microsoft Excel is covered briefly in this course in relation to integration with the other Microsoft Office Suite products.
Introductory Business Math prepares students for success in business and financial mathematics. This course emphasizes the development of business-related numeracy and the fundamentals of the time value of money.

###### Three-year Advanced Diploma
* It’s the most established Behavioural Science program in Canada and has been around since 1971.
* You will receive 875 hours of training across four placement.
* All faculty in the program have worked in the field and have extensive clinical experience in a broad range of sectors.
* Our program is consistently rated as one of the top college programs in the province.
* Given the intensity of the program, we require specific admission requirements. Applicants to the program must meet the minimum requirements to apply.  If you don’t have the required admission requirements, then you cannot apply to the program.
* Due to the foundational courses delivered in level 1 of this program, advanced level entry applications are not considered. Students with previous post-secondary credits who apply to level 1 can request transfer credits through the usual process. 
* Receiving transfer credits will help to lighten a student’s course load in a given semester(s) however there is no way to progress through the program in a shorter period. It will still take three years to complete the program.  
* Prior experience in the field is certainly an asset to a student’s success in the program. Unfortunately, previous work experience is not considered equivalent to academic course work.  Work experience cannot therefore be used as an exemption unless the student has completed the college’s [PLAR process](https://www.stlawrencecollege.ca/apply/prior-learning-assessment-and-recognition). Even if a student is successful in obtaining credit for work experience through the PLAR process, this will not shorten the length of time it takes to complete the program. 
* Currently, there are no distance education options for the program or specific course work.
* Education
* Developmental Disabilities
* Autism
* Acquired Brain Injury
* Mental Health
* Vocational training
* Addictions
* Seniors care
* Forensics/Corrections
* Our graduate employment rates are strong for both programs and many students obtain work post-graduation.
* It’s important for graduates to remember that, as with any employment sector, the ability to be flexible is key when looking for employment. Our graduates are in high demand and some students gain employment directly from their placement experience(s).  Given the fact that mental health and community services are fields that rely heavily on government funding, it’s important for graduates to be knowledgeable about which sectors have a higher demand for our graduates than others and to be willing to work in these fields if necessary, even if not the student’s preferred sector.  Students who gain employment in the field post-graduation are those who are willing to start with part-time and/or contract work and who are initially open to taking jobs that might not be in their preferred sector.  Students are also encouraged to consider work outside of the Kingston area as many exciting opportunities can be found in other cities across the province.
* Each sector is different, and graduates should expect to find variance in salaries.
* The diploma program is an academically rigorous program and requires that students have strong organizational, time management, writing and analytical skills. Some students who come directly from high school to the diploma program find that they must adjust to a new way of learning and to new academic expectations.  It’s important for students who enter a college program to understand that they will be responsible for their own learning and that deadlines are important to meet. 
* It is generally recommended that students work no more than 10-15 hours per week if they expect to be successful in this program.
* Students in the are required to complete the first two of four placements in an educational setting.
* If students meet specific requirements in their educational placement settings, then they will be considered for placements in other settings.  While students provide their areas of interest for subsequent placement consideration, it is program faculty who are responsible to assign students to specific placement sites.  This is to ensure that the appropriate students are matched to each site and to optimize each student’s success on placement.
* We have just established a pathway between BSP and the Honours Bachelor’s Degree in Behavioural Psychology. It is expected that we will be able to begin to accept applications for this program beginning spring 2021. Please note that students must first complete the Behavioural Science program in its entirety (three years) prior to being eligible to apply to the pathway. 
* Many of our graduates also successfully go on to complete their degree in psychology or sociology at university. Most institutions will provide graduates who have a three-year advanced diploma with credit for their first year of a three or four-year undergraduate degree.  Some students have been able to successfully secure more credits than just one full year, but each post-secondary institution varies, and graduates would need to explore options available to them directly with these receiving institutions. 
* There is an increased demand in the fields of autism and developmental disabilities for practitioners to be Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBA’s) or Board-Certified Assistant Behavior Analysts (BCaBA’s). While we do not have a verified course sequence with the BACB, our program does provide students with sound training in ABA and many of our graduates are employed in sectors without board certification.
* The best place to start is our Recruiting Department. They have a lot of good information about the program(s) and the college in general. Their email is: [ASK@sl.on.ca](mailto:ASK@sl.on.ca)

At St. Lawrence College, we are committed to our vision of Students First. We understand that each individual has unique needs and you may have potential barriers keeping you from pursuing post-secondary education. The STRIVE program works in three areas to support students pursing post-secondary education: Outreach, Transition and Retention.
Through a new funding initiative, we are enhancing our outreach services to make college a viable option for individuals who may not have considered post-secondary education. If you are a student who identifies with having barriers to achieving success, the STRIVE program is here for YOU!
What we currently offer on campus to support our students:
* Assistance in accessing and connecting to college services and resources
* A safe environment to discuss issues important to students
* Support with the transition to college life
* One-on-one academic and career advisement
* And much more!

WELCOME TO ST. LAWRENCE COLLEGE
A Message from Glenn Vollebregt, President and CEO
Serving SLC is an incredible honour, and I am fortunate to be surrounded by an amazing group of dedicated professionals who are as devoted as I am to our collective goal of putting our students first in all that we do.   
Whether you’re at SLC to study full-time, part-time, upskilling with one of our micro-credentials, or you are part of the employee team, we work hard to create a college where everyone feels welcome and knows they belong here.
In ten years as SLC’s president and CEO, it has been an incredible journey for me, personally and professionally, and I want to share three things I have learned over the past decade:
1. Get out of your comfort zone. Put yourself in new situations that may feel uncomfortable. It doesn’t need to be skydiving or scaling mountains; it could be as simple as raising your hand to deliver a speech when you have a fear of public speaking or joining a new group for a bike ride when you usually ride solo. The point is, challenge yourself and put yourself in new situations – it’s how we grow as people.
2. Take care of your mental well-being and personal wellness. Create balance in your life and recognize when you are being stressed. Have outlets that help you deal with life’s pressures. Each of you will have different methods to handle stress. For me, I try to keep a regular fitness routine. Whether it is cycling, running, playing tennis with my son, Josh, or doing yoga and HIIT workouts with my wife, Theresa, or taking our dog, Lily, out for a walk, I’m always getting some type of exercise. It helps me deal with the daily complexities that come my way.
3. If you’re in a meeting and you’re the smartest person in the room, you need to find another room. Fortunately for me, this rarely happens, and I always get to stay in the room. My point is, always listen and learn from others. There are some truly brilliant and inspiring people in this world. Surround yourself with them!
I hope to meet as many of you as I can as I walk our hallways. As always, please feel free to reach out to me, and to my team. We’re all here for you.

"After I was laid off from work, I wanted to return to school but I was afraid of failure. I registered for the Environmental program, was accepted, but after twenty years away from school, I wanted a refresh. The program coordinator suggested some courses that I could take to prepare. Now I'm ready and confident to start my program in September."
"After recently completing an honours degree in biology, I didn’t feel quite ready to enter the workforce. The Environmental Technician program gave me the additional skills that I was looking for. It offers a hands-on approach to learning skills and concepts, which can then be applied to almost any environmentally related career."

Bringing Anatomy to Life: Innovative Esthetics Teaching through Play and Reflection
December 03, 2024
|
Categories: Our Programs
Teaching anatomy and physiology to esthetics students presents a unique challenge, especially when scheduled for 7:30 am on Wednesday and Thursday mornings!   Coming into the  Esthetics program, we have learners with varying degrees of familiarity with the subject. To address this, I embraced the principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) to create a dynamic, inclusive learning environment. By combining traditional methods, hands-on activities, interactive technology, and reflective practices, I transformed the classroom into a space where students not only learned but also deeply connected with the material.

## Overview
This program trains students in both theoretical and practical aspects of medical transcription through simulated case studies, tailored to meet industry demands. Graduates will be prepared for entry-level positions in hospitals, medical clinics, physicians' offices, and online transcription companies.
To ensure student success, we recommend prerequisites, even for healthcare professionals. Many professionals concentrate on specialized skills, which may not fully prepare them for the breadth of topics covered in the course. For example, those specializing in cardiology may have limited exposure to areas like obstetrics, orthopedics, and nephrology, which are essential components of the program's curriculum. 
To successfully complete this program, participants must complete eight (8) compulsory courses and two (2) electives.
**Important Notes**
* Due to high demand, register early.
* Students are responsible for any course materials required.

[Top](#top)
Zachary Greenlees was a 2020 graduate of the Business Administration - Marketing program at St. Lawrence College, who had hopes of someday owning his own business. Zac passed away in early 2021 while doing something he loved. His love of the outdoors was abundantly clear with his passion for fishing, hunting, boating/sea-doing and snowmobiling. He lived his life to the fullest. His other passion was working with his father and brother Ben at their shop, The Barriefield Market. He would greet everyone with a warm hello and a big smile. His inclusive nature and friendly nature were greatly appreciated by faculty, classmates, and friends from both SLC and Regiopolis Notre Dame. This bursary will honour Zac’s memory by supporting a student who exemplifies the wonderful qualities Zac had to learn and succeed in the same program that Zac loved so much.
 
**_Created in memory of Zachary Greenlees, a 2020 graduate of the Business Administration – Marketing program, the bursary is available to an entering or returning student in the Business Administration – Marketing program who demonstrates Zac’s leadership qualities and spirit of inclusivity and is in good academic standing. The recipient must demonstrate financial need._**

### Conversations In Colour & Form: Anne Barkley & Brenda Clarke 
### **Eddie Vander Baaren: Pottery & Paintings** 
**About the exhibits:** 
On exhibit from **June 17 – July 26**, visitors to the Marianne van Silfhout Gallery in Brockville will enjoy two concurrent exhibits.  
The main gallery features a selection of paintings by artists Brenda Clarke and Anne Barkley. The exhibit “Conversations in Colour & Form” explores relationships in landscape paintings that have been approached through the polarities of detail and abstraction. 
The foyer gallery showcases a selection of pottery and paintings by Eddie Vander Baaren. Works on display will demonstrate Eddie’s skill and creativity in single fire glazing and raku alongside a selection of paintings in a variety of mediums. 
The joint reception to celebrate these 3 artists will be on Saturday, July 6th from 1 – 3 pm. 
I am primarily a representational artist and potter, crafting pieces that are both functional and easily recognizable. However, I enjoy pushing the boundaries of exact representation, creating forms that evoke a sense of suggestion rather than explicit depiction. This subtle ambiguity excites me, and I continuously strive to imbue my work with a hint of mystery.
For me, pottery and painting are journeys that reflect my emotions and perceptions of each day, guiding my hands intuitively. The final pieces, whether in clay or on canvas, often surprise me with their unexpected outcomes.
**Bio**
Born and raised in Brockville, my artistic journey took an unconventional path. High school lacked art classes, and it wasn’t until after graduation that I delved into the world of creativity. The summer of 1973 marked my initiation into pottery, followed by unforgettable drawing lessons with Mr. Aromi, who imparted the quirky wisdom of using fresh bread as an eraser with charcoal. Fast forward to 2011, I established my pottery studio, dedicating most of my spare time to the intricate dance of potting and painting—a testament to the enduring passion ignited by those early artistic encounters
**Artist Statement**
My subject matter is eclectic, often abstracted; my process, intuitive. The paintings lead my continuing quest through exciting new forms of expression.
I endeavour to capture something of the spirit of people, inspired by the beauty of our Canadian landscape. Step into a world of simple, strong abstract shapes and beautiful colours. I invite you to enter and negotiate the implied spaces, to study what is imagined, to write your own story.
**Artist statement**
In my work, I endeavour to capture something of the spirit of people and their environments, often inspired by the beauty of our Canadian landscape. I invite the viewer to step into a world of simple but strong abstract shapes and beautiful colours, and to respond by finding a personal meaning. That response seems to bring the fulfillment or completion of my creation. The images invite the viewer to enter and negotiate the implied spaces, to study what is seen or imagined, to write their own story.
**Memberships, Fellowships, Awards**
I am an elected member of the Ontario Society of Artists, the Society of Canadian Artists, and a fellow of the Ottawa Watercolour Society. I have four times been invited to exhibit at the Bienalle in Florence Italy, and I did exhibit there in 2009.
I have won awards for my work, including with Ottawa Watercolour Society, Cornwall Regional Art Gallery, Ottawa Mixed Media Artists, and at The Artist Project in Toronto.
I co-founded and participated in the South Dundas Artists Guild. Since that time I have actively participated in many other groups: St Lawrence College Alumni Association, Thousand Islands Fine Arts Association, Brockville Artists Studio, Cornwall Regional Art Gallery, Ottawa Art Association, Ottawa Water Colour Society, Ottawa Mixed Media Association, Art Association of the Visual Arts Eastern Ontario, and Eastern and Central Ontario Artists Association. I was also a member of the Ottawa Artists Cooperative, GalleriArt, for its lifetime.
**Exhibitions**
My work has been exhibited at many galleries and shows. A list of some of these:
**Galleries:** Ottawa Art Gallery, Leonardo Gallery, Wellington Street Art Gallery, Denison Gallery, PI Creative Art, Karger Gallery, cube Gallery, Brockville (several)
**Shows:** Toronto Art Expo, Ottawa Art Expo, Toronto Artist Project, Toronto Outdoor Show

**Bio**
Brenda found a passion for painting just over 8 years ago and has developed her skills through formal training and  
practice. Her love of art and painting is expanding as she explores new styles and techniques, using mainly oil paint  
applied with palette knife and brush. She feels each of her paintings tells a story of something that has resonated  
with her through an experience often of a place she’s visited for the first time. Her adventurous nature lets her  
discover many different locations throughout our beautiful country which allows her to often paint en plein air. 
Brenda has participated in numerous exhibitions and juried shows throughout the Brockville area. She has had the  
honour of having 2 of her works recognized as the “Peoples Choice Award” in two juried shows. In 2020, during  
the pandemic Brenda, along with a fellow artist organized the ‘Art in the Yard” - Pop Up Show and Sale. This  
enabled 20+ local artists and artisans to showcase their work in an outdoor environment for all to enjoy.  
“I am blessed to live in a diverse community of talented and supportive artists; this makes me challenge myself to  
continuously explore how I paint and see the world. I am grateful when others appreciate my work and my heart  
swells knowing that pieces are hanging in their homes, what better reward is that!” 
 
Brenda’s work can be found in homes across Canada, the US and France. 
 
**Artist Statement**
 
Painting has opened my eyes to seeing what surrounds me in a new and exciting way. Using the skills I’ve learned,  
exploring with photography and painting en plein air helps me convey what resonates with me. Having the ability  
to travel our beautifully diverse Country gives me the opportunity to share a “snap shot” in paint of my journeys.

## **Tax Information (T4A)**
The T4A tax form from SLC reports the amount of funds a student has received in scholarships, bursaries, and awards (internal and external) in any calendar year. This form will be mailed to the address on your SLC.me account.
## Frequently Asked Questions
**T2202**
T2202 is an official statement for income tax purposes of the tuition and fees paid for qualifying programs and courses that you are eligible to claim on your income tax return. The form is usually available around the end of February for the tuition and eligible fees paid in the preceding calendar year.
**T4A**
A T4A is an official document for tax purposes. It provides the amount of funds a student has received in scholarships, bursaries, awards, and prizes and/or income if you worked at SLC in a tax year.
SLC has an obligation to issue a T4A tax form for all award payments made through the College and will issue T4As for payments made on behalf of external agencies, as required.
Anyone who was a student at St. Lawrence College in 2023, and who paid eligible tuition and fees, can self-print a T2202 directly from [slc.me](https://slc.me/+CSCOE+/logon.html) on or after February 28. The T2202 will not be sent by mail.
Student T4A’s are printed and sent out by the college via regular mail by the end of February of each year. Please ensure your current mailing address is updated on your SLC.me account.

**T2202**
Contact the IT Services Desk at extension 1000 or **[slc.me@sl.on.ca](mailto:slc.me@sl.on.ca)**.
**T4A**
Please ensure your current mailing address is updated on your SLC.me account. If you no longer have access to your student account, please update your address by contacting:
Last name A-K:  Nicole Williamson – **[Nwilliamson@sl.on.ca](mailto:Nwilliamson@sl.on.ca)**
Last name L-Z:   Kayla Young – **[KLYoung@sl.on.ca](mailto:KLYoung@sl.on.ca)**
Access to **[slc.me](https://slc.me/+CSCOE+/logon.html)** is available from any computer in a St. Lawrence College library or computer lab that has a web browser. You can also request a copy from the Registration Services Officers by emailing **[enrolment@sl.on.ca](mailto:enrolment@sl.on.ca)** and providing appropriate identification. There will be a $20 charge for this service. Anyone who was an eligible student in 2022 can self-print their T2202 from slc.me. 
SLC is required to report this information to all students to enable them to complete their Canadian income tax returns.
While living in Canada, you are required to file a Canadian income tax return. Like an employer issue a T4 for salaries or wages you have earned while in Canada, similarly the College issues a T4A for scholarships, bursaries, or other monetary awards you received during the calendar year.
Students are not required to submit a printed copy of the T2202 form with their tax return, even if the T2202 credits are transferred to a parent. A printed copy is only required when requested by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) as part of a formal audit.
The total amount of fees paid may not necessarily correspond to your T2202 because not all tuition and related fees are tax deductible. 
The T2202 is based on the tax year (January to December) and not the school’s academic year (September to August).
St. Lawrence College is required to make the T2202 available to the student directly. Students must use the T2202 on their own return until the Federal Tax payable is reduced to zero. At this point, the student may transfer the balance of the credit to their parent using the information on the T2202 related to the transferring of unused credit as per the Income Tax Act. The student is required to sign the T2202 authorizing the transfer. Please see Canada Revenue Agency documentation for further clarification.
In addition to claiming eligible tuition and related fees, full time students who are enrolled in ten or more course hours per week, for three consecutive weeks in a month, are eligible to claim an Education Deduction amount for each month of full time study. Part time students must be enrolled in a program that lasted at least 3 consecutive weeks and required at least 12 hours of instruction each month to qualify for the education amount. Please see Canada Revenue Agency documentation for further clarification.
You can use your T2202 form even if the address is not correct. Remember that it is not necessary for students to submit the T2202 form with the tax return, but they must produce it if requested by Revenue Canada. We strongly suggest that you keep your address updated by contacting the Registration Services Officers by emailing **[enrolment@sl.on.ca](mailto:enrolment@sl.on.ca)**
If you feel that the information on your T2202 form is incorrect, please review all of these FAQ’s to ensure that you understand the period they are issued for and the amounts that are included and excluded. If after reviewing this information you feel that your form is incorrect, please contact the Registration Services Officers by emailing **[enrolment@sl.on.ca](mailto:enrolment@sl.on.ca)** to discuss your form.
As per the Income Tax Act, students may not combine receipts from institutions to meet the minimum eligible fee.
Yes, you can print your T2202 as many times as you like. Keep in mind that the T2202 is not submitted with a student’s tax return but is required when transferring amounts to someone else as permitted by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) or if you are being audited.
No, not even your parents can obtain confidential information without your written consent. St. Lawrence College gathers and maintains information used for purposes of admission, registration and other fundamental activities related to being a member of the college community and to attending a public post-secondary institution in Ontario. The policy regarding the release of information about students is intended to protect the individual student's right to privacy and the confidentiality of his or her record. Personal Information Protection Guidelines and the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA) govern access to confidential information at St. Lawrence College.
Based on the Canada Revenue Agency guidelines (See FAQ #15), not every student will be eligible to receive a T2202. However, if you are eligible to receive a T2202, they will not be made available via slc.me until the end of February.  Eligible recipients should be able to access their T2202 on and after February 28.

[Top](#top)
St. Lawrence College (SLC) is pleased to announce the appointment of Jennifer Haley to the role of Dean Interdisciplinary Studies and Pathways and the Cornwall Campus. Jennifer will begin her new role effective February 12, 2024. 
In the last six years at SLC, Jennifer has demonstrated inclusive and progressive leadership, first as Cornwall Campus Associate Dean, then as Associate Dean for Interdisciplinary Studies and Pathways. Most recently Jennifer has contributed towards successful programs and student success as Associate Dean for Allied Health.  
“Jennifer’s progressive leadership, plus her prior experience managing partnerships with Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) leading technical services and research projects at the River Institute, and having been an educator herself, will serve her well in her role as our new dean,” said Glenn Vollebregt, SLC President and CEO.  
Jennifer is passionate about science and lifelong learning. She completed her undergraduate degree at Western University where she received a Bachelor of Medical Science with an Honors in Microbiology and Immunology and then completed a master's in microbiology and Immunology at the University of Ottawa. Jennifer’s background includes leading research and projects in health and environmental fields and teaching. She started her career at the National Research Council of Canada, Stacie Institute for Molecular Sciences.
In 2008, she joined the River Institute in her hometown of Cornwall. While at the River Institute, Jennifer was involved in several projects, including strategic planning and the development of an applied research branch focusing on industry driven research needs. Her role at the River Institute was also her first connection to St. Lawrence College, as she taught part time for nine years in a variety of programs.

# [Reports and Policies](https://www.stlawrencecollege.ca/about/reports-and-policies) 
 _https://www.stlawrencecollege.ca/about/reports-and-policies_

As part of the value of Belonging, SLC supports an inclusive teaching and learning environment that respects and values the diversity of our students. In fall 2021, Policy AC836: Academic Accommodations for Religious, Indigenous and Spiritual Observances Policy was introduced. Under the Ontario Human Rights Code (OHRC), SLC faculty and employees are required to accommodate students’ rights to practice their individual faith observances. As the diversity of our student population grows, it becomes critical that we understand students’ rights and work to set up our programs to accommodate individual spiritual practices.
This student-focused policy provides consistent structure and practice for accommodations resulting from a conflict between academic obligations and religious, Indigenous, and spiritual observances, ensuring (as per OHRC), every individual has the right to be "treated equally based on creed, and to freely hold and practice creed beliefs of their choosing". Like accommodations under other OHRC grounds, such as disability, we have a duty to accommodate to the point of undue hardship.
The Student Wellness and Accessibility team includes a Spiritual Care Facilitator, who focuses on spirituality as a key foundational component of overall health and well-being. Through direct support and/or linkages to community faith groups, the College’s Spiritual Care Facilitator builds an ongoing safe and healthy community for all students on all campuses, regardless of denomination, faith tradition, or spiritual conviction.

The Senior Vice- President, Advancement, Student and External Affairs is responsible for the appeal process.
5\. A student who makes a complaint found to be vexatious, mischievous, or malicious, following the investigation under the Complaints Procedure, is deemed to be in breach of the **[Student Code of Conduct](https://364599a3-cdn.agilitycms.cloud/Attachments/6-about/reports-policies/reports-and-policies/academic-policy/Student%20Code%20of%20Conduct.pdf)** policy.

**1\. Step 1 – Informal Process (Front-line)**  
1.1 Concerns are raised in the first instance with the person or area concerned as soon as possible and no later than five working days after the incident.

The Complaints Resolution Office forwards the complaint to the appropriate senior manager for follow-up and response.
2.3 The senior manager investigates the complaint and responds to the complainant within ten working days. The manager may decide to:
• Propose an amicable settlement.
• Dismiss the complaint as unfounded with reasons.
• Uphold or partially uphold the complaint, offer an apology, and take appropriate steps to address the issue and avoid a similar problem in the future.
2.4 All complaints are to be addressed as quickly as possible. All formal complaints (Step 2) are acknowledged in writing, including the detailed response, within 15 working days. All formal complaints receive a formal written response outlining the outcome and the right of appeal where appropriate. The Complaints Resolution Office is copied on all decisions.
St. Lawrence College has posted a new policy on free speech that has been endorsed by all of Ontario’s 24 colleges.
The policy was developed by a task force of senior college leaders in collaboration with the College Student Alliance, legal experts and others.
The policy statement is primarily based on the University of Chicago’s Statement on Principles of Free Expression and has five core elements:
* A definition of freedom of speech.
* A commitment to allow open discussion and free inquiry.
* A statement that it is not the colleges’ role to shield members of the college community from ideas they disagree with.
* A statement that while members of the college community are free to contest the views of others, they must also respect the rights of others to express their views.
* An affirmation that speech that violates the law is not allowed.
The policy describes the procedures for handling complaints and ensuring there is compliance. The policy also states that it is aligned with other college policies and they shall all be considered together. Once it takes effect, it will apply to the entire college community.
