# [Be Creative and Sprint with us! — Innovation Hub at SLC](https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/news/creativesprint-6rmtt) 
 _https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/news/creativesprint-6rmtt_

Starting September 23rd until October 4th the Innovation Hub will be facilitating a creative sprint where we will provide daily challenges through our Instagram and Twitter. These challenges will focus on building your creativity skills during fun activities.
### “What good is an idea if it remains an idea?  Try.  Experiment.  Iterate.  Fail.  Try again.  Change the world.” – Simon Sinek  
### **What is a Creative Sprint?**
### “The ‘greatest hits’ of business strategy, innovation, behavioral science, and more — packaged into a step-by-step process that any team can use.”
Creative sprints are typically multiple day processes that get a whole team together to define the challenge, come up with a lot of ideas, build the best ideas and test them out.
They are used by larger organizations like Google, Amazon among others but can be used throughout any small or large team.
### **How do I Participate?**
When you see the challenge of the day on either or Twitter or Instagram- simply follow the instructions then tweet, comment, and share your creative skills in use!
### Remember to tag us and use these hashtags #creativesprint & #innovationslc
If you have any questions please reach out to Jadon our Innovation Hub Associate at [jhook@student.sl.on.ca](mailto:jhook@student.sl.on.ca)

# [Marketing Bootcamp & The Innovation Challenge — Innovation Hub at SLC](https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/news/marketingbootcamp-fjtgb) 
 _https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/news/marketingbootcamp-fjtgb_

### By Zachary Milligan
It was not long ago that I was one of those bright eyed students,finally getting to dive into their major. However, when I did the Innovation Challenge we did not have The Innovation Hub, where the later students would have. While there were many locations in the school well suited to lectures, meetings, conferences and most any other function you could think of a college needing. What we did not however have was a large activity space to spread out and be creative. This is where the Innovation Hub comes in to add value to SLC.
The Innovation Hub was designed for activities that involve a high degree of active participation, making experiential learning techniques, such as those used by the Marketing Program, really shine. In addition to the large main space furnished with three smart boards and multitude of school and crafts supplies, there are three smaller adjoining rooms for breakout activities and large meetings, and the ever present staff whose job it is to lend a hand in anyway to keep guests happy and events running properly. The spaces follow a set of values that focus on collaboration, creativity, social impact, and critical thinking amongst students. This alone makes the Innovation Hub the perfect space for hosting The Innovation Challenge. 
The Innovation Challenge is facilitated by Pam Bovey Armstrong, Kathleen Wright, and Polina Buchan, our wonderful marketing faculty at the college. In it, the students are presented a large used tire at the front of the room and are informed of the strain on society and the environment that the massive amount of used tires around the world causes. Their job is to form groups to come up with a product that is a derivative of recycled tires. It doesn’t end there though, once the ideation phase is complete the students then gather in front of a panel of judges comprised of faculty, business people from the community, and former students to present their product. Winners are chosen, trophies are handed out, but in the end everyone gets practical entrepreneurial and sales experience on day one of classes. And doesn’t that make all of us winners. 
 
The Innovation Hub isn’t only beneficial to marketing students however, providing various services to the school and community. It was designed with a purpose in mind that is transferable across all programs. Any faculty member from any program has the right to book the space so long as they can relate the activities facilitated to the Innovation Hubs values of creativity, critical thinking, reflection, collaboration, and social impact. With these far reaching values no matter what field of study someone finds themselves in, they will surely be able to take advantage of the Innovation Hub. 
Looking out on these new students, I feel comfort in the knowledge that they will never be at a loss for space in their education. I can rest assured that now every program has a space to get

Innovation is taking action. It’s a powerful force that propels us forward, pushing boundaries, and creating new possibilities. But what happens when we can’t take action? Not because we don’t have the [tools](https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/tools) to move forward with our ideas, but because the fear of failing is so powerful that we become paralyzed. We invited distinguished performance coach [Dan de Luis](https://www.dandeluis.com/) to the Innovation Hub to guide us through the mechanisms to embrace innovation fearlessly.

 _https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/news/discover-a-new-meaning-7zm97_

### By Jadon Hook
### **Why a Social Hackathon?**
* To provide an experiential learning experience that will assist in the development of student’s critical thinking skills and career readiness.
 
* To encourage the use of the SLC Innovation Hub with Kingston businesses and non-profits.
 
* To furnish students with real-world social views through interaction with mentors, those with lived experience and other faculty streams.
 
### **What is a Social Hackathon?**
A hackathon is a fun way to demonstrate that a lot can be achieved when people work collaboratively together, building solutions rapidly and with an agile approach.
A spirit of open collaboration underpins the hacking philosophy. Bringing together a broad spectrum of intelligent people with diverse backgrounds can result in problem-solving solutions that would never have occurred through any one group in isolation.
### **Who can do a Social Hackathon?**
The short answer is, everyone. A Social Hackathon is a great way to collaboratively solve problems in a fun interactive way or to simply develop your skills when real-life problems face your team. Students, faculty, and staff should do a Social Hackathon to ready themselves for employment and for staff to teach these learned skills to their students. Sponsors, alumni, businesses, and non-profits can all gain tremendous benefits from getting involved and working together in a Social Hackathon.

The rapid pace keeps you on your toes and fosters an environment where wild, unconventional ideas can emerge and thrive.

# [The Why's of Entrepreneurship — Innovation Hub at SLC](https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/news/test-blog-post-3-e6wtf-rnxf7)

### By Jadon Hook
There are many benefits to wanting to become an entrepreneur and when you speak to successful entrepreneurs, they all have a different story of why they chose their path that typically range around these 5 values that I am calling the “5 Why’s”.
### **Pursuing your Passion**
This is something that will always inspire current and future entrepreneurs. Passion is a driving force for individuals that have an idea or dream they want to achieve, passion makes “work” fun and keeps your vision clear and passion will drive others to join your team and will share that same dream.
### **Flexible Lifestyle**
There’s a lot of hype about having a flexible lifestyle but the truth in entrepreneurship is that you’re going to work hard and long, so don’t choose this way of life if you’re thinking it’s a shortcut. You will work hard, but there’s much more flexibility to the entrepreneurial lifestyle than the traditional nine to five and two weeks of vacation time that corporate life permits.
As the adage goes, entrepreneurship is living a few years of your life like most people won’t so that you can spend the rest of your life like most people can’t. It is hard work but with that effort comes the ability to shape your life how you see fit.
### **Unconventional Ideas**
Entrepreneurship takes imagination and perhaps even a dash of insanity. Entrepreneurs are the ones who change the world. They see the world as they want it to be, not how it is. From the genius idea that drove the Wright Brothers to create a flying machine to the madness that drove Steve Jobs and Bill Gates to develop personal computers, entrepreneurs pursue the ideas that others deem crazy.
Albert Einstein said, “Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere.”
### **Too Creative for the Corporate Environment**
You may find that you simply don’t fit in. Sometimes that can feel frustrating, however, if you learn to embrace not fitting into a corporate culture the way many of your friends and family do, you can discover something beautiful.
### **They Want to impact the World**
Entrepreneurs don’t just want to change their lives -they want to impact the world.
Mark Twain explained the lure of entrepreneurship best when he wrote, “Twenty years from now, you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. So, throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.”

### By Jadon Hook
As someone who is a zero-waste advocate and environmentalist, I try to go against the grain with traditional items that “require” paper or other resources when they are easily made available digitally. This stands true for most items with some examples being online classes, course outlines, emails over letters (although I prefer handwritten letters) and most common being notes. I have tried to digitize my notes and type them out mostly due to my poor penmanship, however, I find I use these notes less than my traditional handwritten paper notes. Turns out there is research that backs this up.
However, there are many studies that prove that paper simply stimulates our brain more than digitized notes, reading, and studying which are 3 vital aspects to being successful as a student.
This study from [_Science daily_](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/04/140424102837.htm) details that handwritten notes are more effective for studying and understanding your content and handwritten notes engage more of the senses. The brain is more active, so the learning process is enhanced. This is part of an area of study called “haptics.” Researchers in this arena are studying the way our minds and bodies interact in the learning process. It’s the “tactile” or “kinesthetic” learning idea in action.
The more physically active you are, including taking handwritten notes, the more likely you are to remember information well. So, educational exercise and physical exercise are not as different as you may think. The brain, like the body, needs to be worked and stretched in order to grow and strengthen. While the saying, “No pain, no gain” is over-used athletically, it is undervalued in the academic world.
If handwritten notes really do engage more of the senses, and therefore more of the brain than typed notes, then wouldn’t it make sense to exercise more of your brain than less?
Why don’t more students take handwritten notes? Well, from personal experience legibility, speed, and clutter all come to mind. Having messy handwriting can sometimes make studying with those notes frustrating and when it is unorganized that can lead to missing key information. However, even with these cons to handwritten notes I still strive to take notes on pen and paper as I find they help me remember and understand the concepts I am learning!
So, we can all do more to reduce the amount of paper in our day-to-day, but still taking handwritten notes because they help you increase retention, knowledge, learning and growing in your field.

# [Overcoming the Fear of Failure in Innovation with Dan de Luis — Innovation Hub at SLC](https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/news/overcoming-the-fear-of-failure-in-innovation) 
 _https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/news/overcoming-the-fear-of-failure-in-innovation_

Innovation is taking action. It’s a powerful force that propels us forward, pushing boundaries, and creating new possibilities. But what happens when we can’t take action? Not because we don’t have the [tools](https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/tools) to move forward with our ideas, but because the fear of failing is so powerful that we become paralyzed. We invited distinguished performance coach [Dan de Luis](https://www.dandeluis.com/) to the Innovation Hub to guide us through the mechanisms to embrace innovation fearlessly.
Dan brings a unique blend of expertise to the table, drawing from his background in yoga, meditation, breathwork, and biohacking. With a wealth of experience, he offered participants an interactive workshop designed to unravel the mysteries of the fear of failure in the realm of innovation.
Sharing insights on authenticity, emotional well-being, and confronting fears, Dan shared his personal wellness journey, emphasizing the role of yoga and spirituality in his life, and how these practices helped him confront his fears and achieve a deeper sense of self-awareness.
Together, we examined what it means to be happy, peace of mind, and the power of being authentic. Highlighting the importance of internal growth and overcoming past challenges, we learned some tips and tricks for balancing personal well-being with professional commitments, especially in high-stress environments. Dan capped this transformative session by immersing the group in transformative breathwork techniques designed to make our bodies work for us, quelling anxiety, and preparing us to tackle any challenge mentally and physically.
As always, we are grateful when Dan is in our presence and look forward to the next opportunity to host him in the Innovation Hub.
Follow Dan de Luis online for more techniques, daily affirmations, and general positivity:

> “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone, there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”
— Frank Herbert

# [From E-Waste to Empowerment: Repair Together's Impact in Action — Innovation Hub at SLC](https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/news/repair-together-build-sprint) 
 _https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/news/repair-together-build-sprint_

The digital age has transformed our world, making us increasingly dependent on technology, but unfortunately, not everyone has equal access to its benefits. This gap between those who have access to technology and those who don't can drastically impact opportunities and quality of life.
Imagine trying to learn or get a job without internet access. That's the harsh reality for many Canadians due to the "digital divide." This gap hurts low-income communities most, leaving them without affordable devices, internet, and crucial digital skills. Even if they have devices, [Canada's sky-high internet costs](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/strategic-policy-sector/en/telecommunications-policy/price-comparisons-wireline-wireless-and-internet-services-canada-and-foreign-jurisdictions-2019) make staying connected a struggle.
The consequences are serious. People miss out on online learning, face limited job options, and accessing essential services becomes a challenge. This exclusion perpetuates cycles of poverty and further widens the gap between the privileged and the disadvantaged. But this past week, we took steps towards closing that gap with a 3-day technology repair workshop with [**RepairTogether**](https://repairtogether.org/), a local charity dedicated to making technology accessible for everyone.
Ever wish your old phone or computer could find a new purpose? Enter RepairTogether, a student-led initiative at St. Lawrence College making waves in in our local community! Founded by [**Heather Reid**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/heatherdawnreid/), a passionate Computer Systems Technician student, RepairTogether tackles the digital divide by refurbishing donated devices and distributing them to local organizations like [**HomeBase**](https://kingstonhomebase.ca/)**,** [**Dawn House**](https://www.dawnhouse.ca/), [**The Kingston Youth Shelter**](https://kingstonyouthshelter.com/), and more.
Last week, the Innovation Hub buzzed with activity as Heather and her classmates hosted a 3-day repair workshop. Not only did they gain valuable hands-on experience fixing laptops, phones, and more, but their efforts directly benefited the community! By the end, 17 devices were ready to be gifted to those who need them most.
This heartwarming project wasn't just a learning experience; it showcased the power of collaboration. RepairTogether has been met with overwhelming support from incredible faculty here at St. Lawrence College including **Michael Drew**, [**Michael Carter**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mcarter2013/), [**Steve Janssens**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-janssens/), [**Jadon Hook**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jadonhook/), and [**Kai Chung**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaiachung/), proving that we can innovate learning experiences in previously unthought-of ways that benefit, teachers, students, and the greater community. We are excited to watch RepairTogether grow and create more space for community collaboration in our city.
Inspired by RepairTogether's success? Do you have tech gathering dust? Donate it to [**contact@repairtogether.org**](mailto:contact@repairtogether.org) and be part of bridging the digital gap in Kingston! Let's work together to ensure everyone has access to the technology they need to thrive.

# [Why Many Are Moving Away From The Term ‘Stakeholder’  — Innovation Hub at SLC](https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/news/why-understanding-the-history-of-words-makes-us-more-inclusive) 
 _https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/news/why-understanding-the-history-of-words-makes-us-more-inclusive_

Welcome back to another Innovation Hub blog! Today we will explore not only a new tool but the new language surrounding it. Let’s take a look at the Intrest Holder Map and why the business industry is moving away from the term “stakeholder”. 
### **Shifting the Language: A More Inclusive Approach**
You might be familiar with the term "stakeholder" often used in project management and business planning. While previously common, many have moved away from this term due to its historical connotations. The term "stakeholder" has roots in the colonization of Indigenous Peoples in Canada, where it referred to ‘settlers’ claiming land by using wooden stakes. These decisions to ‘claim’ land happened without the input or knowledge of the people who were affected by the decision, the Indigenous Peoples whose land it was. This created ironic conditions for the origin of a word meant to speak about including people who are affected by a decision or project during the planning process.
To foster a more inclusive environment, the term "Interest Holder" has been adopted which more accurately reflects the diverse connections within a project. "Partner" is another strong term to consider, but it often suggests a more active and collaborative role. The Interest Holder Map encompasses a broader range of connections, including those who may be less involved than a project partner or sponsor.
### **Building a More Inclusive Future**
At the Innovation Hub, we believe in using language mindfully and fostering a more inclusive environment. By understanding the historical context of words, we can create a more respectful and equitable space for all innovators. Spaces like these foster true innovation and collaboration because they make every voice heard. The Innovation Hub is always taking steps to provide a welcoming and open space for everyone within our community. 
### **Identify Your Champions: What is the Interest Holder Map?**
Our newest tool visualizes project planning by helping you identify the involvement level of everyone connected to your project. We call these individuals and groups **Interest Holders**. Interest Holders can be anyone who can be impacted by, or contribute to, the success of your project. By understanding these connections, you can build a strong project team and ensure your project is effective.
**When planning your project, consider key questions like:**
\- Who might be affected by this project?
\- Are there similar projects that have been attempted before?
\- Who can provide valuable expertise at different stages?
The Interest Holder Map helps you answer these questions and helps to identify the people who can play a crucial role in your project's success. Interest Holders strengthen a project through support and providing opportunities. They help to ensure a smoother project journey as their insights can help you anticipate and navigate potential roadblocks.
### **How to use this tool**
After identifying who your Interest Holders are you will then plot them in the chart. Ranking both their level of interest and their ability to influence the project. By doing this it will allow you to understand how these Interest Holders can affect your project moving forward. This then allows you to understand how to interact with each party and what they can bring to the project to ensure its impact. 
### **Ready to Map Your Success?**
We invite you to explore the [Interest Holder Map](https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/tools/interestholder-map) and see how it can empower your next project. Visit our website to check it out and explore how the Interest Holder map can elevate any project you may be working on. 
> “You have a responsibility to make inclusion a daily thought, so we can get rid of the word ‘inclusion.”

# [Money Saving Tips for First Year Students (from a Third Years Perspective)  — Innovation Hub at SLC](https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/news/slcmoneysavingtips-zxbc6) 
 _https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/news/slcmoneysavingtips-zxbc6_

### Written by Sarah Villeneuve
First-year of college, the first true taste of freedom for many young adults. In your first year of college, there are tons of fun things to do and take advantage of that you may not even realize how much you're spending until you see your very sad bank statement.
It may seem impossible to save money while in college, but thankfully SLC provides various opportunities and services to help student slow down their daily spending.
### Check out our list below to see SLC Kingston’s best kept secret money savers! 
1.  Free coffee in the SA (8:30 am – 10 am), you just have to bring your own mug. And even FREE breakfast snacks every Monday morning!
2\. Another good reason to bring your own coffee mug. Both Browns and Tim’s at the college allow you to bring your own coffee cup and save 10 cents off your coffee, also get a rewards card towards a free coffee.
3.  Eco-containers help you save money and the container waste of eating in the cafeteria. They not only help the environment but that few cents you save will really add up when using Eco-containers  
4.  Want to hang with your friends but don’t want to pay to do something? The SA has tons of video games, board games, and even ping pong and pool for students to use!
5. Before you buy that recommended textbook, check out the SLC Library to see if they have a copy available. Photocopy the pages you need costs a lot less than buying a whole textbook you may never open again…. or not open in the first place.
6.  Watch out for events with cash and money-based prizes! Grocery Bingo is one of the main events that the SA puts that gives Loblaw’s gift cards as prizes.
7.  USE YOUR BUS PASS. You’ve already paid for it in your tuition, at this point it’s just free transportation. While in school it’s a great way to get around without having to worry about a car and all the stress that comes with it. 
8.  Are you a gym buff or interested in starting to go to the gym? With your SLC student card, you get free access to all of the Kingston YMCA’s locations, programs, and services. It’s a really great way to get introduced to the gym and realize what you like before you pay for it.  
In my first year, knowing about some of these great opportunities would have saved me a lot of money and stress in the long wrong. That’s why I’ve decided to share this with all of you, to see what SLC provides to help student slow down their daily spending.

### Students Build a Digital Double 
Did you know that cities around the world are using digital twins to optimize traffic flow, predict natural disasters, and even design future urban spaces? This cutting-edge technology is revolutionizing industries from manufacturing to healthcare. At the Innovation Hub, we're exploring the potential of digital twins to transform [education](https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/news/sz6h9qqenutazrzhtj2ioib81dqfal). On Friday, August 16th the Innovation Hub welcomed Cesar Hernandez’s class from the Technological University of Riviera Maya in Mexico. These students gave a small talk at Enactus’s AXIS “tech meetup” event. During their presentation, these students spoke about how they created a digital twin of their classroom, library, and auditorium. Showcasing the potential of the digital twin’s technological power and its potential to reshape learning experiences. 
### Understanding Digital Twins  
Imagine a copy of something from real life inside a computer – that's a digital twin! It's like a virtual model that's constantly updated with real-time information. Beyond factories and hospitals, digital twins are being used in aerospace, energy, and automotive industries to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance decision-making. 
### Students Build a Real-World Digital Twin  
At the Innovation Hub, we love it when students try out the latest technology and turn their big ideas into something real. This semester, a group of university students from Mexico, who’s professor is our very own [Cesar Hernandez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cevidhernandez/), did just that. Their challenge was to build a "digital twin" of their classroom, a project mirroring the Innovation Hub's summer focus of creating a digital twin of it’s own space. This project was presented to the students at the beginning of their semester and the students would spend the next four months tirelessly working to complete their assignment.  
Cesar had this to say about the project: “As an educator, I believe that academic partnerships are crucial for enhancing global education. By exposing faculty and students to a multicultural approach, we can develop a more enriching and comprehensive learning-teaching process. Technology plays a fundamental role in this process. A few years ago, establishing alliances between institutions in different regions was not as accessible as it is today. Fortunately, this gap is closing with the advent of current technologies, such as immersive technologies, AI, and other collaborative IT tools. As an academic and IT professional, I am committed to supporting the adoption of this cooperative approach for quality education.” 
### Overcoming Challenges in Digital Twin Creation  
Cesar's students initially attempted to use an application called Polycam to scan their classroom and create a digital twin. However, the resulting models contained an excessive number of polygons, causing problems with the computer's ability to display them smoothly. Undeterred, the students took a creative approach, constructing every element of the classroom from scratch using Blender, a powerful 3D program. This method granted them greater control and ensured optimal computer performance. 
### Bringing a Digital Classroom to Life  
The students went beyond replicating the classroom's basics. They meticulously recreated the auditorium, complete with a stage and tiered seating, and transformed the library into a digital space with virtual bookshelves. This attention to detail brought their digital environment to life. 
### Balancing Aesthetics and Functionality in Digital Twin Development 
Throughout the project, the students learned to balance realism with what a computer can handle. They are beginning to understand the art of creating visually appealing 3D models while optimizing them for smooth computer performance. Cesar's prior experience leading the creation of a digital twin of the Innovation Hub for Enactus Canada’s Bentley challenge proved invaluable in guiding the students. His expertise contributed significantly to the project's success, if you would like to learn more check out Enactus SLC’s blog on the challenge [here](https://www.enactusslc.ca/news/enactus-slc-takes-on-bentley-itwin4good-challenge-securing-national-success)!
### The Future of Education with Digital Twins  
As these tech-savvy students embark on new adventures, their digital classroom will remain as an inspiration for future students. Imagine attending virtual classes, collaborating on projects in immersive environments, or exploring interactive exhibits within this digital space. 
Carlos Rojas one of Cesar’s students had this to say about the experience: “It was a great pleasure to participate in the presentation and exchange. Since our professor Cesar Hernandez shared the idea with us, we embarked on this beautiful journey. We were very excited about the project itself as virtual reality, 3D, and video are topics we are passionate about.” 
### Shape the Future of Education  
This project exemplifies the Innovation Hub's commitment to experimentation, problem-solving, and shaping the future through creativity and teamwork. We're immensely proud of Cesar and his students for demonstrating the incredible possibilities that arise from combining passion and technology.

# [What Makes a Great Leader? SLC Community Unveils the Secrets of Great Leadership — Innovation Hub at SLC](https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/news/what-makes-a-great-leader) 
 _https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/news/what-makes-a-great-leader_

The best leaders are always learning. On March 25th the Innovation Hub was doing just that! We, along with over 50 members from the SLC community took part in a learning workshop about how to be an effective leader. We learned about the difference between leading ourselves and leading others, and how to do both effectively.
We heard from the always insightful [**John Conrad**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/conradjohn/), our very own Director of Innovation and Business Engagement, about these great topics and how to become strong leaders ourselves. The workshop delved into the key differences between leading yourself and leading others, equipping us with tools to excel in both areas. We learned the importance of **continuous learning, asking questions, and fostering compassion and curiosity**. These qualities, along with open communication and collaboration, all contribute to building strong relationships – the foundation of effective leadership.
**A big thanks to** [**Michael Richards**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelrichards10/) **for organizing this event, and to** [**Emma Laporte**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emma-laporte-460506265/) **for sharing her inspiring leadership journey!**
**Want to get involved?** The Innovation Hub is always open to collaborating on community-oriented initiatives. If you're a student or faculty member with an idea, connect with us or book a room [here.](https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/the-rooms) Let's keep these impactful events happening!

# [Realms becomes part of something bigger: AXIS "Tech Meetup"  — Innovation Hub at SLC](https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/news/realms-becomes-part-of-something-bigger-axis-tech-meetup) 
 _https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/news/realms-becomes-part-of-something-bigger-axis-tech-meetup_

**A New Chapter: From Realms to AXIS “Tech Meetup”**
The world of Virtual Reality (VR) has a surprisingly long history, with some arguing its roots reach back to the 1800s. In 1838, Charles Wheatstone's stereoscope allowed people to view flat images in 3D, making the birth of VR nearly 200 years ago. Today, VR use has exploded across various industries, from entertainment to training and education. As emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI) gain prominence, many industries are integrating them into their processes. That’s where Realms comes in! Let’s dive into the history of our Realms initiative and explore what it is turning into.
**Realms: Launching VR Learning**
The growing momentum of VR in the professional sphere inspired the Innovation Hub to foster similar innovation within our community. We created Realms, a launchpad for students and faculty to explore the capabilities of VR. During the program's development, we drew inspiration from case studies like PricewaterhouseCoopers. This case study highlighted the potential of VR as a learning tool, stating it provided students with a deeper understanding of their course materials.
The weekly Realms events proved the case study right in every way. Participants were highly engaged, and their detailed discussions during and after the events showed the value of VR. Witnessing firsthand how students were learning through this immersive technology was incredible to be a part of.
**Challenges and Overcoming Obstacles**
Despite the success of Realms, inspiring VR adoption always has its challenges. Many faculty members were unsure of VR's value, mirroring a wider trend. As showcased in a Perkins Coie case study, over half of businesses need help to integrate VR into their existing systems. Additionally, many individuals, including some faculty members, expressed a need for more knowledge or confidence to use VR effectively.
Some faculty members questioned how VR could be incorporated into their classes and felt unequipped to teach students how to use the headsets and software. Others were concerned that VR might not be suitable for their classes and could potentially hinder learning.
However, Realms continued to offer a low-barrier way to explore VR. Due to the program's accessible nature, faculty members began to take notice.
**Realms pops-up in classes**
As professors, administrators, and other faculty members started attending the events, they began to understand, alongside the students and the team, the benefits of VR. This growing enthusiasm led professors to seek Realms' assistance in facilitating VR workshops tailored to their specific course material. These workshops provided students with an unparalleled opportunity for immersive learning across various disciplines, from marketing to mental and physical health.
The positive impact was undeniable. A group of students participating in an interview workshop were surveyed. They reported an average confidence increase of 16% after regular use of the program in VR and other mediums. 
**Realms Evolves into AXIS: Tech Meetups.** 
As Realms continued we began to see a growing interest from the participants in exploring a wide array of emerging technology. People were coming to Realms not just to understand and explore VR but to have meaningful conversations about Artificial Intelligence (AI). People came to delve into the different AI tools and how to use them both effectively and ethically. Realms began to expand and include many different emerging technologies from AI to blockchain technology and NFT art. 
As people continued to come and immerse themselves in the world of technology and all it had to offer it became obvious that this weekly event was no longer just about exploring VR. It was about exploring all emerging technologies and their potential in the academic and professional worlds. This is where AXIS comes in, it aims to solidify this space and give the community the chance to fully explore all emerging tech and everything it has to offer. 
**Learn more about AXIS “Tech Meetup”**
The Hub is proud to be a founding partner of AXIS “Tech Meetup” in collaboration with Enactus SLC. We will be welcoming a great lineup of community partners every week to help us explore all of these emerging technologies, and we can’t wait to continue learning with our SLC community. We will see you here at the Innovation Hub every Friday from 3 pm - 5 pm.

[Overcoming the Fear of Failure in Innovation with Dan de Luis](https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/news/overcoming-the-fear-of-failure-in-innovation)
Innovation is taking action. It’s a powerful force that propels us forward, pushing boundaries, and creating new possibilities. But what happens when we can’t take action? Not because we don’t have the [tools](https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/tools) to move forward with our ideas, but because the fear of failing is so powerful that we become paralyzed. We invited distinguished performance coach [Dan de Luis](https://www.dandeluis.com/) to the Innovation Hub to guide us through the mechanisms to embrace innovation fearlessly.

# [Lotus Blossom — Innovation Hub at SLC](https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/tools/lotus-blossom) 
 _https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/tools/lotus-blossom_

The Lotus Blossom tool is a structured brainstorming technique designed to explore ideas in depth by breaking them down into sub-themes around a central concept. This method encourages detailed thinking and the expansion of initial ideas into more refined and actionable insights.
In the Lotus Blossom exercise, the central theme or problem is placed in the middle of the central grid. Surrounding this central theme, fill in related ideas or sub-themes. Each sub-theme then becomes the centre of its own Lotus Blossom, further breaking down into more specific ideas. This iterative process helps uncover deeper insights and innovative solutions.
### How to use the lotus blossom:
* Begin by writing the main theme or problem in the center of the Lotus Blossom diagram.
 
* Fill in the surrounding squares with related ideas or sub-themes.
 
* For each sub-theme, create a new Lotus Blossom and repeat the process, breaking down the ideas further.
 
* Continue expanding until a comprehensive network of ideas is formed.
 
* Review the results to identify actionable solutions.

### Happy Holidays SLC!
As the holiday season begins, this time of year unites everyone in the spirit of giving, kindness, and our common humanity. To coincide with this magical time of year, we here at the Innovation Hub are running the It Would Mean A Lot Letter Drive event.
The It Would Mean A Lot Letter Drive has one singular purpose, to collect and write as many letters as possible to send to Canadian soldiers serving overseas and far from home. In honour of the spirit of the season, we would like to remind these people that they are not alone, that there are people that are still thinking about them.
### So how do you get involved? There are 2 ways;
1\. Our Collection Box located at the Innovation Hub Office will be open from now until December 13th.
2\. Our main It Would Mean A Lot letter-writing event, held December 12th from 12:30-3:30 p.m. in the Innovation Hub, where we will have all the supplies for you to write your letter. This event will be open to everyone and we encourage anyone who has the time to stop on down and pen a letter.
We would like to thank anyone who participates in advance for helping support our troops. Have a happy and safe holiday SLC.
Have questions? Please email our staff at [zachary.milligan@student.sl.on.ca](mailto:zachary.milligan@student.sl.on.ca) and [jhook05@student.sl.on.ca](mailto:jhook05@student.sl.on.ca)

# [Mayor's Innovation Challenge: Info Session & Workshop — Innovation Hub at SLC](https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/news/mayors-innovation-challenge-info-session-workshop) 
 _https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/news/mayors-innovation-challenge-info-session-workshop_

January is thought to be a slow and calm month. We are still in the grips of our wet, cold, Southern Ontario winter. We are reflecting on 2023, and setting new goals for 2024. However, Kingston takes its resolutions seriously. We hit the ground running in 2024 preparing our city and the bold innovators that live within it for the annual Mayor’s Innovation Challenge by hosting an information session and workshop.
Held in collaboration with the City of Kingston, the Dunin-Deshpande Queen’s Innovation Centre, and St. Lawrence College, the Innovation Hub was buzzing with creative energy as students from Kingston's post-secondary institutions gathered to tackle real-world challenges facing our city. The workshop aimed to inspire and empower students to develop innovative solutions that could shape the future of Kingston, kicked off by Mayor [**Bryan Paterson**](https://mayorpaterson.com/), whose opening remarks set the tone for an engaging and productive session.
We then heard from [**Virginia Sytsma**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/virginiasytsma/), Program Coordinator Queen’s University DDQIC, who spoke about some amazing opportunities Queen’s has to support budding entrepreneurs, including the [**QYourVenture**](https://www.queensu.ca/innovationcentre/launch/qyourventure) program.
The Q&A period provided an invaluable opportunity for students to seek clarification, share insights, and collaborate with their peers. The diverse range of perspectives and expertise in the room enriched the discussions, fostering a dynamic atmosphere of learning and discovery.
As the workshop drew to a close, participants gathered for the Ideas Bazaar, a lively brainstorming session where concepts were shared, refined, and expanded upon by each participant contributing their unique insights and expertise to the conversation. It was an extremely difficult night to end as the energy and excitement for new ideas, projects, and plans, flowed from the group. Suffice to say, we are looking forward to what our students contribute to this year’s challenge!
Learn more about the Mayor’s Innovation Challenge [**here**](https://www.cityofkingston.ca/city-hall/projects-construction/mayors-innovation-challenge). Submit your proposal by Sunday, Feb. 25, 2024 to be considered for the student pitch competition.
Do you need to practice your presentation skills for the Mayor’s Innovation Challenge or any other pitch opportunity? Join us every Monday for Open Podium to hone your skills and receive valuable feedback and advice from experienced innovators to help shape your plans.

The Journey Map is a valuable tool for visualizing and understanding the user's experience throughout a specific process or interaction. It allows you to create a detailed, step-by-step representation of the user's journey, helping you identify pain points, moments of delight, and opportunities for improvement.
A well-constructed Journey Map typically includes key process stages, emotions, and insights gathered from user research. It provides a holistic view of the user's interactions, making it easier to pinpoint areas where changes or enhancements can be made to enhance the overall user experience.
