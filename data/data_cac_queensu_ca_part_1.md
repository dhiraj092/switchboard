## FAQ
How do I get on the Cluster?
The standard way to access the Frontenac cluster is through **ssh**.
We are currently operating **only one login node** that is accessible from the outside through ssh. The IP address for this (CentOS Linux) login node is **login.cac.queensu.ca**.
[Read the Full FAQ on the Frontenac Cluster Wiki](https://info.cac.queensu.ca/wiki/index.php/Access:Frontenac)
How I change my password?
###### Re-setting a new password when you have forgotten it
If you want to obtain a new password for accessing the Frontenac system, or if you have forgotten your password and can't login to the system, please (re-)activate your account by following these steps:
* [Visit Password Reset Portal](https://login.cac.queensu.ca/pwr) and enter your username and email address. **Note that the email address must be the one we have on record for you.**
* Don't forget to check the "I agree to the AUP" and "I'm not a robot" boxes before you hit the "Submit" button.
* The system will send you an email with a link. Click on it.
* You will be presented with a **temporary password** which you can use to log in.

How do I run jobs using a scheduler?
SLURM is the scheduler used by the Frontenac cluster. Like Sun Grid Engine (the scheduler used for the M9000 and SW clusters), SLURM is used for submitting, monitoring, and controlling jobs on a cluster. Any jobs or computations done on the Frontenac cluster must be started via SLURM. Reading this tutorial will supply all the information necessary to run jobs on Frontenac.
[Read the Full FAQ on the Frontenac Cluster Wiki](https://info.cac.queensu.ca/wiki/index.php/SLURM)
What are my disk space and quotas?
The Frontenac cluster uses a shared GPFS filesystem for all file storage. User files are located under `/global/home` of **500GB** quota, shared project space under `/global/project`, and network scratch space under `/global/scratch` of **5TB** quota. In addition to the network storage, compute nodes have between up to **1.5TB** local hard disk for fast access to local scratch space by jobs using the location specified by the `$TMPDISK` environment variable. 
[Read the Full FAQ on the Frontenac Cluster Wiki](https://info.cac.queensu.ca/wiki/index.php/Filesystems:Frontenac)
How are jobs allocated?
The Frontenac cluster is partitioned to enable the efficient and fair allocation of jobs. There are three main partitions: **standard**, **reserved**, **sse3** _(decommissioned)_.

### **The CAC’s Resources and Services**
* All researchers in member institutions and across Canada, including postdoctoral associates, graduate students, undergraduate students (if doing research), research associates, and research staff are eligible to apply for accounts on the CAC’s systems.
* For a default account for the Frontenac Cluster, institutional credentials are required.
* The CAC acknowledges that high-quality research projects often require large resource allocations and encourages researchers to tackle problems that require as much computing as can be delivered. Nevertheless, the CAC’s resources must be shared equitably. The CAC seeks to balance the two goals fairly.
* Normally, all users have equal access to the CAC’s resources. Users who need and can use all of CAC’s computing resources on a large-scale problem are encouraged to contact us to arrange for additional resources through our [intake process](https://tinyurl.com/CACintake). 
* The CAC exercises no control over the content of the information passing through the CAC’s equipment. The CAC makes no warranties of any kind for the service it provides.
* The CAC will not be responsible for any damage a user, or any other person, suffers in connection with the use of the CAC’s facilities. This includes damage resulting due to delays or service interruptions.
* The AC staff make every effort to prevent loss of data in the event of hardware or software failure, or through human error. In rare cases, it may not be possible to restore data files from backups, and some may be lost. The CAC will not be liable to any person for any loss or corruption of any data, records or information placed on the system. Users agree to indemnify and save the CAC harmless from all liability.
* Each user agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the CAC from any claims resulting from the user’s use of the service.
* The CAC will maintain an up-to-date registry of all the CAC’s compute resources, licensed software, and the location of those resources.
* Each user agrees to indemnify and hold harmless CAC from any claims resulting from the user’s use of the service.
* In the event that the CAC has actual knowledge, or there are reasonable grounds to believe, that the user may be in violation of any of the restrictions under CAC policies, the CAC shall have the unrestricted right to terminate or suspend the user’s rights under this policy.
* The CAC reserves the right to refuse extra computing resources to users if their code cannot use the extra resources efficiently. Users are encouraged to attempt problems that require large resources, but the onus is on the user to ensure that their code can use the resources efficiently.
* All resources are shared. Users are subject to a default allocation ([see wiki pages for details](https://cac.queensu.ca/wiki/index.php/Allocation)) on the Frontenac cluster. This allocation is a target, i.e., contingent on availability.
* The default usage of our resources is through a queuing system. The scheduler implements resource allocations, priorities, fair-sharing policies etc. System usage outside of the scheduler requires specific permission.
* The CAC can maintain regular backups for the purpose of disaster recovery. We do not provide archiving services for default accounts.
* If an account is deactivated, the CAC archives or retains the data for a grace period. Temporary data (for instance “scratch”) are not preserved and may be deleted at any time. Past this period, if no action was taken to reactivate the account, we reserve the right to permanently delete the data. 
* Security issues and related services are addressed in the Security Policy.
### **Software and Licenses**
* The CAC is responsible for supporting only software that it has explicitly agreed to support. The list of supported software will be reviewed periodically and will be posted on the CAC website. Send requests for new software to our ticketing system at [cac.help@queensu.ca](mailto:cac.help@queensu.ca).
* For licensed software, the CAC requires users to sign a statement agreeing that they will abide by the terms of the license. Access to the software is contingent on this statement.
* Users can install software on our systems in their own domain if it is appropriately licensed and not available to anyone but the licensee(s). The CAC will assist users to protect their licenses but cannot be held responsible for infringements.
* The CAC will not be held responsible for any license infringement by any user.

# [Data Capture - Centre for Advanced Computing](https://cac.queensu.ca/systems/data-capture/) 
 _https://cac.queensu.ca/systems/data-capture/_

What is REDCap?
REDCap is a secure web application for building and managing online data collections and surveys and is commonly used worldwide. The tool was developed and is maintained by Vanderbilt University.
Is REDCap free to use?
Most academic and research institutions offer REDCap as a support service based on a cost recovery model or free of charge depending on the institution and the intended usage. 
The Centre for Advanced Computing (CAC) at Queen’s University hosts many REDCap instances for the different faculties and departments. The hosting and consultation services are free for all Queen’s University affiliated researchers, but this is subject to change. Development support is also available but offered at cost.
How do I access REDCap?
If you are a primary investigator, contact your department to see if there is already a dedicated instance available. If not, then you can submit a CAC Intake Form to request a new instance. 
If you are a research associate or a student, contact your primary investigator to request an account. 
Once an instance has been provisioned and a user account has been created, you can access REDCap through a web browser using the URL and user login provided to you through the signup email notification. 
For grant applications and research publications, make sure to cite REDCap. You can contact the CAC for more information about proper citation.
[CAC Intake Form](https://queensu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8dcn8wDLgZma2KG)
Do I need programming skills to use REDCap?
Most REDCap features are available through a user interface, so programming skills are not necessary for basic tasks.
Can I use REDCap for longitudinal studies and to run multi-site studies?
Yes, REDCap supports longitudinal studies, which allow you to collect data from the same participants over time. The tool also supports multi-site studies through data access groups (DAGs) to restrict data access across sites.
Can I export data from REDCap for analysis?
Yes, REDCap provides various options to export your data in formats compatible with statistical analysis software like Excel, SPSS, and R.
Can I collaborate with others using REDCap?
Yes, REDCap supports collaborative research efforts by allowing multiple users to access, enter, and manage data while maintaining appropriate access restrictions.
Is there a mobile app for REDCap?
Yes, there are mobile apps available for both iOS and Android devices to allow users to complete surveys and forms offline. Users can also complete surveys and forms online through a web browser with a link.
Can I store PHI in REDCap and is REDCap HIPAA-compliant?
You can store PHI in REDCap if you follow HIPAA regulations and implement the necessary safeguards to ensure the privacy and security of the data. REDCap can be configured to be HIPAA-compliant, but it requires careful setup and adherence to Health Canada guidelines to ensure the security and privacy of protected health information (PHI). Achieving HIPAA compliance is a complex process and involves more than just the tool itself. It involves a combination of technical measures, administrative practices, and staff training to ensure the security and privacy of PHI. You can consult with your institution's compliance experts for more information.
What privacy and security measures does the CAC have in place for their hosted REDCap instances?
* Data in transit is always encrypted.
 * Clients use HTTPS to interact with the tool through the web browser and have to authenticate via the web application’s login mechanism. TLS is used to handle HTTPS encryption. The website’s SSL certificate uses Enhanced Validation, which is approved by Queen’s University and signed by Entrust.
 * CAC administrators use SSH for server configuration. Access is only allowed on-site to keep traffic within the secure CAC data center only and authentication is conducted via local system accounts. SSH also provides encryption for data in transit.
* For greater security, the REDCap web application runs on a separate host from the database with a firewall enabling communication between web server and the database. The firewall ensures that all traffic is blocked except the ports necessary for users to access the website and CAC administrators to access the servers. A TSM backup client is installed and uses TLS to send backup data encrypted to the backup server.
* This setup, as a whole, complies with the best practices in the industry.
What security features does REDCap offer for HIPAA compliance?
REDCap emphasizes data security and offers user access control, in-transit data encryption, and audits to ensure the confidentiality of your data. It also supports at-rest data encryption, but administrators have to configure this based on user requirements.

# [Security Policy - Centre for Advanced Computing](https://cac.queensu.ca/security-policies/security-policy/) 
 _https://cac.queensu.ca/security-policies/security-policy/_

#### Information is an asset that the CAC has a duty and responsibility to protect. The confidentiality, integrity and availability of information is an essential part of functioning consistent with client needs and expectations.
As a data centre, the organization stores and provides tools to process information, which may include confidential information. As such, CAC shares a responsibility with its clients to help safeguard information and prevent its misuse.
The purpose and objective of the Security Policy is to set out a framework for the protection of information assets at CAC. It aims to:
* to protect CAC information from all threats, whether internal or external, deliberate, or accidental
* to enable secure information sharing
* to encourage consistent and professional use of information
* to help all parties understand their responsibilities in using and protecting information
* to ensure business continuity and minimize business damage
* to protect CAC from legal liability and the inappropriate use of information
The Security Policy is a high-level document and adopts several controls to protect information. The controls are delivered by additional policies, standards, processes, and procedures supported by training and tools.
### **Scope**
This document outlines a framework for the management of Information Security at the CAC.
The Security Policy, standards, processes, and procedures apply to all staff and employees and contractual third parties who have access to the information systems or assets.
The Security Policy applies to all forms of information stored on CAC systems.
### Structure of this Policy
This policy is high-level and is supplemented by additional security policy documents which provide detailed policies and guidelines relating to specific security controls.
The CAC will undertake risk assessments to identify, quantify, and prioritize risks. Controls will be selected and implemented to mitigate the risks identified.
The following controls are in place at the CAC to reduce risk:
* Policies and Procedures
* High Availability and Secure Infrastructure
* Roles and Responsibilities
* User and Staff Training
* Segregated Architectures
* Internal and External Audits
### Security Policy
The security policy sets out an approach to managing information security.
The security policy is approved by management and is communicated to all staff and employees and contractual third parties.
The security requirements for CAC will be reviewed at least annually by management. Formal requests for changes will be raised for incorporation into the Security Policy, processes, and procedures.
### Organization of Information Security
This Policy and additional procedures help ensure that Information will be protected from a loss of:
* Confidentiality: Ensures that information is accessible only to authorized individuals.
* Integrity: Safeguards the accuracy and completeness of information and processing method.
* Availability: Requires that authorized users have access to relevant information when required.
All incidents of information security, actual or suspected, must be reported and will be investigated.
Specialist external advice will be drawn upon where necessary to maintain the Security Policy and to address new and emerging threats and standards.
Formal roles and responsibilities are defined and assigned as appropriate to protect the information security systems at the CAC.
All staff and contractors are required to comply with the policies and procedures assigned within.
### Asset Management
All assets including data, information, software, computer and communications equipment, service utilities and people will be appropriately protected.
Owners will be assigned, and they will be responsible for the maintenance and protection of their assets.
### Human Resources Security
Appropriate policies will be communicated to all employees, contractors and third parties to ensure that they understand their responsibilities.
Security responsibilities will be included in job descriptions and in terms and conditions of employment.
Regular background verification checks are carried out on all CAC’s employees.
Information security education and training are made available to all staff and employees.
### Physical and Environmental Security
Secure areas will be protected by well-defined perimeters with appropriate security barriers and entry controls. Staff are assigned physical access only as required.
Critical and sensitive information is housed in a secure area, and physically protected from unauthorized access, damage, and interference from environmental threats.
The data centre will have 24/7 on-call and third-party monitoring of intrusion and environmental systems or other emergencies.

## CAC joins Queen's in new project dedicated to coordinated data support services
Researchers are producing unprecedented amounts of data and data intensive research is growing rapidly across disciplines. Research data support services offered at universities are often siloed, which can cause inefficient duplication of services and significant gaps in programming and support. As a result, there is a need to develop a strategic, unified approach to providing data support services to ensure researchers have access to the tools and resources they need.
To address these challenges, we are pleased to announce that the Centre for Advanced Computing at Queen’s University is amongst the institutional partners participating in [Ithaka S+R](https://sr.ithaka.org/)’s initiative, “[Building Campus Strategies for Coordinated Data Support](https://sr.ithaka.org/blog/coordinating-research-data-services/),” a cohort-based project with 29 universities across Canada and the US. This two-year initiative will support the Queen’s research community through several deliverables that aim to ensure the future viability of research data support services in the following ways:
* Catalogue and analyze the research data services currently offered locally 
* Investigate the experiences of faculty and students in navigating and accessing existing research data services at Queen’s and identify current barriers and gaps 
* Build tools to assist researchers in navigating existing research data services 
* Develop strategic plans for better coordination of current and future services 
In addition, the project will contribute to developing an international benchmarking dataset on current data support services, which will in turn inform our own strategic planning processes. This project aligns with the University’s Strategic Goals to inspire research excellence and advance social impact and sustainability; enhance research and teaching integration; and strengthen the University’s impact on a global scale.
Watch for project updates on progress and for an invitation to members of the Queen’s community participate in interviews to help the implementation committee better understand researcher experiences with current research data services and identify additional support requirements.
We are delighted to have assembled a project team and steering committee with stakeholders from across the University. We would like to thank the Queen’s University Library for funding this initiative.
