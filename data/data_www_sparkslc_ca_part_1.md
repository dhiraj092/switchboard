## Kinarm
#### Interactive Robotics Brain Injury Research
The primary objective of this project was to gain a comprehensive understanding of the training challenges encountered by Kinarm's diverse customer base, including clinical and basic researchers, lab operators, and lab supervisors. The aim was to provide actionable recommendations to Kinarm that would improve their existing training processes and enhance the overall support experience. These recommendations were required to align with industry standards while effectively reducing the number of support requests directed to customer service representatives. To accomplish this, Spark Communications conducted a series of research activities, including historical data analysis, heuristic analysis, surveys, interviews, and focus groups. These activities allowed for the identification of trends, common issues, and pain points experienced by customers, thus providing valuable insights for the development of targeted recommendations. By understanding the specific training challenges faced by Kinarm's customers and delivering recommendations aligned with industry standards, the project aimed to improve the training processes and support experience, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and reducing reliance on customer service representatives.
**The Challenge**
Kinarm engaged Spark Communications to conduct user design research focused on their training and support systems. The objective was to address the increasing number of support tickets and enhance the training experience for customers. The findings revealed challenges such as a lengthy learning curve, limited availability of on-demand information, and a lack of structured training materials. The support team faced difficulties due to the growing ticket volume, over-reliance on support staff, and high turnover of new users. To address these issues, Spark recommends the development of the Kinarm Academy, an online platform offering on-demand training resources and certification programs. Additionally, improving training materials, including concise content and multimedia formats, and implementing enhanced support systems such as a comprehensive knowledge base and proactive customer support, were proposed. By implementing these recommendations, Kinarm can streamline training, empower customers with timely information, and foster a supportive community of Kinarm users.

**Company Assets**
Our research recommendations for Kinarm will greatly enhance service delivery across various areas. The insights gained from the research will serve as a strong foundation for refresher training programs or Kinarm camp sessions, benefiting customers in their continuous learning journey. By implementing these recommendations, there will be a significant reduction in the volume of support tickets submitted. This will enable the support team to streamline internal processes, maintain knowledge, and provide personalized support to customers. Moreover, the recommendations will empower customers to become more independent by efficiently finding the resources they need. The results of the research have identified pain points experienced by different target audiences, such as the need for updated materials, access to facilitated refresher training, and handling high volumes of ticket types requiring further knowledge. These findings will greatly improve the user experience on the website, ensuring a seamless interaction and eliminating any user interface challenges.

Written by **Madyson Kiepprien-Fraser**
_Reading time 3:16 minutes_
Did you miss this month’s episode? Or maybe you’re just looking for a short memory refresher? Either way, welcome to the Spark Compass Blog! A place where we summarize the key takeaways from every episode and share some memorable behind the scenes moments. 
This week’s episode features Rob Howard, a Brand Rehabilitation Therapist who helped us learn what it takes to make a lasting impression with your branding. 
#### WHAT IS BRANDING?
Before we can talk about what branding is, it’s important to understand what it’s not. Branding is not a jingle. It is not the packaging your product comes in or the logo of your business. Most often, branding is intangible - it’s something that cannot readily be held in the palm of your hand. 
Successful branding can be defined as the sum total of all emotions and feelings associated with your business. It’s how your employees feel about their work. It’s the feeling consumers get when interacting with your business. 
When asking yourself about branding, consider how you approach and engage with people. 
#### THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD BRANDING
Mispositioning is one of the most common mistakes businesses make with their branding. It’s easy to make assumptions about how your business is being perceived, but it’s harder to validate those assumptions with research. 
When a consumer identifies a problem, such as being hungry and looking for a place to eat, there are usually 2-3 businesses that immediately come to mind. This is known as an evoked set and, if you’re able to position your business correctly, can be a very powerful marketing tool. Good branding can secure your place in a consumer's evoked set, effectively setting you apart from the competition. 
But what does it take to make this list?
#### BUILDING A SUCCESSFUL FOUNDATION
There are four essential elements to consider when developing your brand.
* Brand Purpose - In time, this will become the core of your brand. A good brand purpose allows your consumers to buy into what your brand stands for and can turn customers into believers.
 
* Brand Promise - This should be greater than a value proposition. It doesn’t need to be tangible but it’s important to know what your brand promise can be so you can articulate it properly. In Rob’s experience, a successful brand promise is like a relationship. It implies a reward for the consumer. From recognition to a good feeling, knowing what influences your consumer to act is crucial for this step.
 
* Brand Personality - This is where the tangible elements of your branding come into play. Things like tone of voice, social media presence, visual identity, etc are all considerations for brand personality. The key to this step is integrating purpose and promise into your personality.
 
* Brand Positioning - There are three aspects to this final step. Consider what you do, who your audience is, and what makes you different from similar businesses. Include some supporting evidence to support your claim to uniqueness and boom, you’ve got the initial research needed for brand positioning. 
 
#### COMPETITIVE RESEARCH & BRANDING
You might be wondering what your competitors have to do with developing a successful brand. If you can understand how other businesses are fulfilling the needs of their consumers, it introduces the opportunity to understand what you do differently than them. 
Competitive research can also create a roadmap for your business. If you’re here today but want to be somewhere else tomorrow, what does your branding need to accomplish to help get you there? If your company has a “best kept secret” that should be known by everyone, then share it! Implement that secret element into your brand to better connect with your consumers. 
#### IMPLEMENTING YOUR BRANDING 
The first fans of your brand should be the people already associated with your business. Advocacy works best when your employees are onboard too. Consider running your purpose, promise, and personality through an internal review to gain support from the people who work hard to keep the business running. 
A key part of implementing your brand into your marketing is maintaining consistency. Creating brand guidelines and artifacts is a great way of informing your employees about how your brand should behave both on and offline. 
Start internally, be authentic, and stay consistent. 
#### TO SUMMARIZE 
It’s important to establish the foundation of your brand before you promote it. The three key aspects of a brand foundation are:
* Brand Purpose
 
* Brand Promise 
 
* Brand Personality

**Company Assets**
In collaboration with Purafy, Spark created a comprehensive range of assets to elevate the brand and enrich the consumer experience. Captivating product images were crafted for the Portage, Shield, and G10 Graphene filter, showcasing their unique features and design. These visuals captured attention and conveyed the quality and innovation behind Purafy's products.
Spark developed a series of instructional videos to facilitate seamless product usage. Tailored specifically for the Portage, four comprehensive how-to videos provided step-by-step guidance on operation and maintenance. Additionally, two engaging video advertisements for the Shield effectively highlighted its exceptional capabilities and benefits. Four supplementary instructional videos for the Shield addressed different usage scenarios, providing detailed instructions for optimal performance. Troubleshooting videos were also created for both the Portage and the Shield, equipping consumers with valuable tips and solutions.
The diverse range of assets, including captivating visuals and informative videos, played a pivotal role in enhancing Purafy's brand presence. By combining visually appealing product images with practical guidance, Spark empowered consumers with the knowledge and confidence needed to embrace and make the most of Purafy's innovative clean water technology.

## City of Cornwall: Profession In Play
#### “Shaping the minds of tomorrow”
Early Childhood Educators are so vital to the education of our youth, they interact with them at the most vital points in their development and are responsible for teaching the fundamentals of learning and life. The City of Cornwall is a beautiful place to live with parks and recreational facilities, they pride themselves on being a good place to raise a family.
**The Challenge**
Families mean kids, and kids mean a need for Early Childhood Educators, and unfortunately, the City of Cornwall found itself in a shortage of these particular professionals. With a low number of Early Childhood Educators, it becomes hard to accommodate a rise in families who are looking to make Cornwall their home. 
**The Solution**
The City of Cornwall teamed up with Spark to figure out the best way to attract new Early Childhood Educators to Cornwall and encourage young adults to choose this as their profession in the future. It was determined that we needed to inform people about ECE and all the great things this career path has to offer.
**Company Assets**
Spark developed a few assets for the City of Cornwall including an in-depth marketing strategy, graphics to be used in their media, as well as video projects. The marketing strategy that Spark provided was backed with extensive research and interviews to ensure it could be effective in the target area now and in the future, it also included helpful guidelines on how to move forward with the assets after the project was completed. The graphics created were fun and full of life to catch the eyes of those viewing, they helped to add a pop to all kinds of media. There were extensive video assets created for this project because they held the key information for this campaign. They informed the viewer of all the things being an ECE in Cornwall could entail, they were visually appealing, and did a great job conveying the key message of the campaign.

Did you miss this month’s episode? Or maybe you’re just looking for a short memory refresher? Either way, welcome to the Spark Compass Blog! A place where we summarize the key takeaways from every episode and share some memorable behind the scenes moments. 
This month’s episode featured Colton Jung, a Digital Lead Generator working for Launch Lab, who helped us explore all things search engine optimization and search engine marketing!
#### SEO & SEM – WHAT ARE THEY AND WHY DO THEY MATTER?
In a nutshell, SEO (aka search engine optimization) is the act of setting up a website in such a way that Google understands how its content connects with customer search queries. Lots of things play into how Google analyzes the information on your website such as content headers, meta descriptions, and relevant keywords. So understanding how SEO works is critical to the improvement and ranking of your website. 
SEM, otherwise known as search engine marketing, is a supporting piece in the process of optimization. When you pay for SEM advertisements, you’re also paying to take up space in Google Search, YouTube, Gmail, and other avenues. This can be a great way of ensuring your website gets displayed in front of your target audience. 
Colton mentions that a rule of thumb is establishing good SEO before moving into paid SEM. Since an optimized website is the baseline (and potential first point of contact for a consumer) you want to make sure that it can be found organically and has all the content that a consumer might be looking for before you start promoting your site. 
#### FIRST STEPS WHEN USING SEO?
Colton suggested two things everyone should know about when first starting out with SEO. 
The first is to understand how title tags and meta descriptions work. These are the actual content displayed within a Google search. Since it’s often the first thing people see when a website is displayed, that makes them very important. Title tags let Google and the user know what that website link is all about. The meta description would be the supporting sub-text, a short description outlining what someone can expect to see if they click on your website link. We’ve linked some helpful articles if you want to learn more about [title tags](https://www.semrush.com/blog/title-tag/?kw=&cmp=CA_SRCH_DSA_Blog_EN&label=dsa_pagefeed&Network=g&Device=c&utm_content=622461213336&kwid=dsa-1754979168445&cmpid=18361978716&agpid=138308711461&BU=Core&extid=60109362925&adpos=&gclid=CjwKCAiA5sieBhBnEiwAR9oh2kJrCIL3Ek1UDzUKLd08KGy6iDDih2Kf62aEjyyp5EBDSrovlluqGRoC9ucQAvD_BwE) and [meta descriptions](https://www.shopify.com/ca/blog/how-to-write-meta-descriptions).  
The second step is image optimization. In short, this is the process of shrinking the file size of images on your website. This doesn’t affect the look or quality of the image, but it will improve the overall speed of your website. If your website has a slow loading speed, potential customers will return to their Google search results to try again elsewhere. 
#### FIRST STEPS WHEN USING SEM?
Once you’re confident that your website will answer any questions potential customers might have about your business, it’s time to consider SEM. When creating paid ads, it’s important that they represent your brand, your competitive landscape, and honestly describe the product/service you’d be promoting. 
There’s different layers to SEM but at the core of it, you should always represent your business in a way that is authentic to the brand. 
#### DOES SEO GIVE IMMEDIATE RESULTS?
No! It’s a common misconception that SEO provides immediate results. SEO is an investment. It’s a long-term strategy that comes to fruition over time and requires habitual input from your end. Colton suggests following the pattern of implementation, analysis, and adjusting. 
* Implementation - Launch your website optimizations
 
* Analysis - Are these changes having the desired effect? Why or why not?
 
* Adjusting - Tweaking areas that need improvement 
 
SEO isn’t a short-term strategy. It’s a business investment that requires constant monitoring and optimization to keep afloat in the highly competitive search engine environment. 
#### COMMON SEO/SEM MISTAKES
Part of the learning process is making mistakes. So here’s a list of the top three most common mistakes business owners make when investing in SEO and SEM:
Automatically Generated SEO 
* When you use a website like Shopify or Wix, placefiller SEO is generated automatically. While this can be a great starting point, the placefiller isn’t always optimized for your business and won’t have the same result as writing it yourself. Remember that a key part of SEO is authenticity and accurate representation of your brand, and who can create customized content better than the person who knows the business best? 
 
Insufficient or Inaccurate Content
* If you don’t write detailed title tags and meta descriptions, then you run the risk of encountering this common mistake. If your website doesn’t have enough content, Google won’t be able to link it with search queries. If the information you do have is inaccurate or misleading, then you risk not being ranked at all for future searches. 
 
Image Optimization
* As we mentioned in earlier sections, not optimizing your images can drastically slow the loading speed of your website and send visitors back to the Google page. 
 
### SEO CHECKLIST FOR FIRST-TIME USERS
Throughout our conversation, Colton provided a checklist with four main elements that first-time SEO users should complete before moving on to SEM. The first task is keyword research, which we’ll discuss more in the next section. Since keywords play a massive role in SEO, it deserves an entire section all to itself. 
Task number two is to organize your on-page SEO. A simplified explanation of on-page SEO is laying out your website in a way that Google can readily understand. Search engines use formatting to categorize on-page information, so the use of headers and prioritizing information is a must. 
Technical SEO is the next item on the checklist. This includes optimizing image sizes, optimizing overall site performance, and more. To learn more about Technical SEO, consider reading this [informative guide](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/technical-seo-guide) written by HubSpot. A large part of Technical SEO is also auditing the performance of your website to see where you’re lacking or succeeding in SEO. The guide linked to the previous sentence also talks about auditing your website for Technical SEO. 
### KEYWORD RESEARCH FOR SEO
If you aren’t sure where to start with researching keywords, there are free tools available to help. Colton suggests starting with Ubersuggest and Google Keyword Planner, both of which can be used without cost. To use these tools, all you need to do is input a keyword or phrase, and they will auto-generate long-tail keywords. You can use these suggestions to find new and unique ways of implementing keywords that authentically represent your business. 
A general rule of thumb for keywords is to use them at least once in the copy of your website content. Keywords should relate to what people are searching for and connect honestly back to your website. The finer art of using keywords is finding ways to use them naturally instead of forcing them into your content. Keywords should be relevant but it’s equally important to find opportunities that don’t compete against massive companies who are already dominating certain keywords. 
Keywords play a huge role in search query results, so sprinkling them into title tags and meta descriptions is a great way to link them back to your website content. Just make sure that if you’re promising certain information in your meta descriptions, that information should also be available on your website. 
After you’ve implemented your keywords, monitor their performance. Audit their results and keep an eye out for opportunities in adding additional, more effective keywords to the mix. 
#### SUMMARIZING SEO INTO THREE POINTS OR LESS
When asked to summarize SEO into three key points or less, here’s what Colton had to say:
* Build an organic connection between your website and google search queries
 
* SEO isn’t a short-term strategy, it needs to be implemented, analyzed, and adjusted
 
* Don’t get into the weeds, stay focused on title tags, meta descriptions, and keywords
 
#### FINAL WORDS OF ADVICE
As for final words of advice, Colton had two additional points to add for anyone approaching SEO for the very first time. Building blogs is a great way of answering customer questions while also satisfying SEO criteria. Blog posts lead to customers organically finding their business instead of using paid ads to force it to their attention. 
The second bit of advice is to spend as much time as you can learning, auditing your competitors, and remembering that SEO is a long game that requires ongoing assessment, input, and modifications.

#### Reflect, Impact, Create, Collaborate
The Innovation Hub is a collaborative and innovation-driven space located within the walls of St. Lawrence College. Anchored by its values of Creativity, Collaboration, Critical Thinking, Reflection, and Social Impact, the Innovation Hub works to build meaningful connections in the St. Lawrence College and Kingston communities.

**The Challenge**
The Innovation Hub is made for people to come together and collaborate, however it is hidden on the 2nd floor of St. Lawrence and many people often miss it or don’t know what it is. The challenge was to reach out to the students and local community to let them know that the Innovation Hub is open and ready to start fostering creativity and innovation.
**The Solution**
To help support the Innovation Hub in meeting its objective of generating awareness around the offerings, benefits, and intended uses for the space, Spark developed a website and branding package that carries the messaging that defines the Innovation Hub as a space for creativity and collaboration. Additionally, Spark produced a captivating video that complemented the website by conveying the same messaging and capturing the essence of the Innovation Hub's dynamic environment.
**Company Assets**
With the help of Spark, The Innovation Hub now has an engaging website that effectively highlights its core values: creativity, collaboration, critical thinking, reflection, and social impact. The website offers a captivating online experience that accurately represents the essence of the space, allowing visitors to explore and connect with the Innovation Hub. They also received a welcoming and informative video highlighting why the Innovation Hub exists, the versatility of the space, and how it benefits St. Lawrence College students and communities. Promoting the Innovation Hub and raising awareness, has prompted members of St. Lawrence College, as well as members of the community, to utilize the space, as well as effectively present the space as a helpful resource.

**The Process**
Rebranding an established institution is always a delicate balance between maintaining the mission, vision, values and identity, with the creation of something new and exciting. Uniquely to this project was the heavy involvement of students on both sides, many whom had no prior branding experience. Our designer, Dhanesha (Dash) steered the highly collaborative journey, moving from diverse moodboards to establish the general tone and feeling, into concepts, always honing the visual direction and culiminating in the final brand logo and visual language.  
In parallel with the early stages of the brand development, we started our UX research, conducting a card sort to identify how students mentally categorized topics, based on the desired page topics for the new website. Over 230 students from the Kingston Campus participated in the online card sort study. After Kara analyzed the results of the card sort study we developed the Tree-Test to test out our navigation and information heirarchy hypothesis. Over 180 students participated in the tree-test, providing us with clear direction on the preferred structure of the website.  
Based on the research conducted, we then developed the wireframe for each page of the website. After the Students Association team approved the wireframes, we then prototyped the primary pages implementing the new branding and visual language in the first expression of the visual language beyond the logo. In collaboration with the Students Association, we refined the site's design within the prototype. During the prototyping stage, we invested a significant amount of time to ensure all colours and fonts used on the website adhered to accessibility best practices. Once the prototype was approved, and the design established, site construction began.  
To align with the new visual language for the Students Association, new headshots were needed. Our internal design team and photographer established the creative brief for the SA to follow for the shoot. We conducted three separate shoots, using a studio within the college to capture the images needed for the website, as well as email signature blocks.  
The final stage of the website development we conductedstress testing the site for any broken links, typos, missing images and documents, implementing on-page SEO, and connecting Google Analytics.

# [Creating A Memorable Narrative: Storytelling with Cory Firth](https://www.sparkslc.ca/blog-page/f0omgnxqcx844zr9u8a6u2stm4ukco)

Written by **Madyson Kiepprien-Fraser**
_Reading time 3:24 minutes_
Did you miss this month’s episode? Or maybe you’re just looking for a short memory refresher? Either way, welcome to the Spark Compass Blog! A place where we summarize the key takeaways from every episode and share some memorable behind the scenes moments. 
This episode featured Cory Firth, a psychedelic storyteller working for Nikean Foundation, who told us all about his perspective on brand storytelling. While we learned much, this author feels it is his duty to also share the story behind this week’s episode. 
Have you ever heard of a little thing called Murphy’s Law? The adage stating everything that can go wrong will go wrong at the worst possible time? That about sums up our behind the scenes for this episode. From corrupted SD cards to robotic audio interferences, we faced it all. 
So Cory, if you’re reading this, thank you for laughing it off and sticking with us to make a memorable filming session. 
#### WHAT IS STORYTELLING IN MARKETING?
Storytelling is one of the most primitive forms of communication. We tell stories everyday even if we don’t always realize it. Stories about our day, a new restaurant we visited, or even about our aspirations for the future. By harnessing storytelling, you can make your business stand out and connect with your audience on a deeper level. 
#### IS IT HARD TO REACH AUDIENCES WITHOUT STORYTELLING? 
The answer given by Cory is that it depends. Countless brands use storytelling as an opportunity to brag about themselves and their accolades, which can leave much to be desired from a consumer’s perspective.
True storytelling begins with identifying the desires and challenges of your audience on an empathetic level. Once you’ve figured those out, you can create stories based on the transformative journey your product/service can provide to the consumer. 
So yes, it can be hard to reach audiences without storytelling so long as a business is using true storytelling to connect with their audiences. 
#### THE STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS TO CREATING A GOOD STORY!
Using the novel Building A StoryBrand by Donald Millet as his inspiration, Cory frequently uses a writing style based on the hero's journey. These begin with the want or desire of the hero and focuses on how the achievement of that desire transforms their lives. This transformation should be centered around a source-based place rather than a symptom-based place. For example, frustration is often a symptom of something occurring in your life. Instead of focusing on the feeling, you should explore the root cause. 
That root cause is the villain of our story. It’s a problem that plagues our hero, causing problems both internally and externally, and it’s this problem that needs to be navigated as your story unfolds. If you don’t understand the villain to your story then you’ll struggle in communicating it to your audience. Shifting your approach to be more philosophical, so looking at why the problem matters to the hero, is a great way to reframe the villain of your story. 
At the end of the day, you should position yourself as the guide rather than the solution. Think of yourself as someone who can lead the hero through their journey but ultimately, each step of the way will be completed by them. They do the work but you inform them of the steps. These styles of stories can empower your reader while still highlighting your business as a figure of helpful authority. 
The last step is to include a meaningful call to action. 
#### CALL TO ACTIONS, YOU SAY? WHAT ARE THOSE?
A call to action, shortformed to CTA, is exactly as it sounds. Your hero needs to be called to action in a few words or less. They can be indirect, which should be short and demonstrate trust, or direct, which provides value for free. 
Indirect CTA’s are often vague and can be confusing for the reader. If their next steps are unclear or up for interpretation, then you should consider re-writing for clarity. 
Direct CTA’s encourage the reader to take a specific action. These are usually statements like:
* Download our free ebook
 
* Sign up for our newsletter
 
* Follow us on social media
 
### DOES STORYTELLING CHANGE FROM B2B OR B2C?
The only element of storytelling that should change is the desire of the hero. It’s important to adapt and monitor which aspects of your story resonate with different audiences. Once you’ve noted which emotional tie relates to the transformative journey, then you can implement it into your story!
#### TO SUMMARIZE!
* Storytelling isn’t all about you, remember to focus on the needs of your audience
 
* Understand the impact and importance of your audiences’ transformational journey
 
* Encourage them to take a leading role in their own transformative story

# [Social Media Channels with Jackie St. Pierre](https://www.sparkslc.ca/blog-page/g2vwzca2ry2z9yhuzlxdok47tvnd0u) 
 _https://www.sparkslc.ca/blog-page/g2vwzca2ry2z9yhuzlxdok47tvnd0u_

Did you miss this month’s episode? Or maybe you’re just looking for a short memory refresher? Either way, welcome to the Spark Compass Blog! A place where we summarize the key takeaways from every episode and share some memorable behind the scenes moments. 
This month’s episode featured Jackie St. Pierre, a professor at St. Lawrence College with over 20 years of experience in post-secondary education. With previous experience in economic development, fundraising, and business development, she helped us navigate the tricky topic of finding the best fitting social media channels for your business. 
#### SHOULD YOU BE EVERYWHERE AT ONCE?
The short answer is absolutely not! The first thing you need to do is understand where your audience can be found. Are they joining communities on Facebook? Or sharing quick thoughts on Twitter?  Maybe they’re curating a colourful feed on Instagram? Figuring out which platforms your audience are using and why are the best first steps you can take when deciding where to establish your brand. 
Don’t be afraid to ask your audience where you can find them, either. Strike up casual conversations with your clients or consider sending out a poll to gather their responses.
#### WHAT’S SEGMENTATION GOT TO DO WITH IT?
If you aren’t familiar with segmentation, consider listening to or reading all about Episode 2: Meeting Your Best Customers with Bill Crowe, where we talk about the best way to segment your audience. 
If you’re in a rush, segmentation is the process of grouping your audience together based on similarities in demographic or psychographic information. Ethnicity, religion, age, opinions and attitudes are just some examples of how you can group your audiences into targeted segments. 
Jackie suggests also using geographics to segment your audience. If you have a store with no e-commerce channels or delivery options, then you wouldn’t want to target consumers in a whole other country. If, however, you know that tourists who visit your shop come from certain cities then you would include them in your geographic segmentation strategy. 
That’s how segmentation plays into things! Once again, it ultimately circles back to understanding your audience and where they are coming from. 
#### HOW DO YOU MAINTAIN AUTHENTIC REPRESENTATION?
It’s easy to think of branding and strategy as separate entities. Successfully incorporating both can introduce unity and cohesion across your media channels. You don’t need to include the entirety of a strategy into your branding, but it is important to include key elements that are foundational to your business. 
It’s also important to remember that not everything you do on social media needs to pitch a sale. Include the consumer journey into your posts and messaging. Connection and recognition can go a long way in building brand awareness and loyalty. Consider whether the content you create will hold any meaning for your consumers and if it doesn’t, tweak what you have until it does!
#### IS THERE A STRATEGY TO ESTABLISHING YOUR MEDIA PRESENCE?
Build your brand into something that your audience will want to talk about. Create a presence that provides value and engages with its followers. Remember that branding and social media aren’t all about you, it’ll always be the customer who determines success or failure in your efforts. Using segmentation, demographics, and psychographics to create a persona document (essentially a fictional character based off real data) can help you better understand your audience and what interests them. 
The best strategy for any brand is the willingness to change ideas and plans. The current social media landscape is never consistent for long and is prone to sudden changes. Making sure your brand can pivot to keep up with these changes can mean the difference between staying current or out of date. 
#### IS THERE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TARGETING B2B AND B2C?
Yes, there is definitely a difference when targeting B2B versus B2C! Social media is a great place to develop your brand and audience but the end goals are liable to change depending on who you target. B2B targeting usually drives traffic to a website to conduct business or prompt a conversation, while B2C can now conduct sales on the social media platforms themselves. 
In terms of marketing on social media, you can still tell stories but they’ll differ slightly. For B2B, sharing success stories and numbers can be a great way of catching people's attention. Then for B2C, creating stories based around the journey of your consumers can be an effective means of gaining their attention and trust. 
#### TO SUMMARIZE IN THREE POINTS OR LESS!
* Start with a plan
 
* Develop a marketing plan
 
* Integrate across all media platforms

Did you miss this month’s episode? Or maybe you’re just looking for a short memory refresher? Either way, welcome to the Spark Compass Blog! A place where we summarize the key takeaways from every episode and share some memorable behind the scenes moments. 
This month’s episode featured Catherine Colasimone, the Director of Digital Marketing at The Small Social Company, who helped us explore the importance of quality visuals on social media. The Small Social Company works with businesses of all sizes to keep their marketing and media communications in tip top shape. Through her time working with local businesses, Catherine developed an eye for best practices and common challenges when creating social media visuals. 
#### WHY DO GOOD SOCIAL MEDIA VISUALS MATTER?
Effective visuals play the leading role when it comes to using social media platforms. It’s a crucial step in establishing your brand, one that quickly allows your audience to consume information about your business. That being said, it’s equally important to understand when and how this information should be shared with your audiences. 
In a post-pandemic society, affiliating a face with your business is an easy step towards humanizing your brand. For individuals who can’t visit you directly, or especially if your brand is focused solely on e-commerce, then building that connection early can be critical for your business. Social media provides a convenient platform for highlighting the face behind the brand and connecting with your audience, which is just one of the reasons why good visuals matter. 
#### HOW DO YOU GET STARTED WITH SOCIAL MEDIA VISUALS?
Photography setups and preferences vary from person to person. For the absolute beginner, Catherine recommends starting with three simple items, one of which is already found in most of our pockets:
* Cellphone
 
* Tripod
 
* Ringlight
 
Mobile tripods and an array of ringlights can be found online at affordable prices. You don’t need to start with break-the-bank levels of expensive gear since the key to this stage is simply getting started. Tripods keep your phone steady and the frame consistent while taking photos or videos. A good ringlight provides even lighting to help product shots look their best with minimal edits. An alternative to buying ringlights is using natural light sources, such as spaces near windows, to take well lit photos. 
When it comes to graphics, platforms like Canva make it easy to take and modify templates. That being said, it can also be difficult to stay consistent when there’s so many attractive options available for use. To stay faithful to your branding, Catherine recommends keeping these three things in mind when designing your graphics:
* Start with brand colours and fonts
 
* Keep your style consistent and authentic
 
* Create something that resonates with your brand
 
Starting with brand colours and fonts means you can quickly tell if a template will work for your business. If it doesn’t work then don’t try to force it. It’s okay to not use every template out there. In fact, curating a collection of similar-looking templates is a great way to keep your graphics consistent. Have you branded yourself as a handmade artisanal business? Then using templates focused heavily on technological themes probably isn’t right for you. No matter how cool a template might look, be sure to stay authentic to your business. 
#### WHAT ARE THE NO-NO’S OF SOCIAL MEDIA VISUALS?
There’s no one-size fits all approach to posting on social media. Each platform is distinct from the next in caption length, graphic ratios, audiences, and more. Creating a visual in a single size and expecting it to look great across all platforms isn’t a recipe for success. When creating your visuals, be sure to review the size requirements of each platform and plan accordingly. 
You should also consider auditing your audiences on each platform to understand what they’re interested in and why they follow your account. Depending on the answer, your visuals might need to change. So don’t be afraid to ask your audience what they’d like to see from you! 
#### ANY FINAL WORDS OF WISDOM?
As we wrapped up our filming session, Catherine offered three tidbits of advice for business owners focused on creating visuals for their social media accounts.
* Start with your end goal and work backwards from there
 
* Stay true to your brand by producing authentic content
 
* Be honest about how frequently you can post online 
 
Keeping all of these things in mind will create a more enjoyable experience that stays true to the nature of your business.

## Texture with Confidence
#### “Sharpening Skills in Hairstyling”
Texture with Confidence is the product of St. Lawrence College & Kingston Economic Development coming together to find a solution to a common problem, hairstylists who don’t know how to work with textured hair. Texture with Confidence offers free training sessions to local stylists, including workshops and question sessions, to help them understand the skills required to work with textured hair. They believe everyone deserves the opportunity to enjoy the salon experience, with no more fear of leaving with something they didn’t want or even nothing at all.
**The Challenge**
As a free workshop, the Texture with Confidence challenge was getting people out of their salons and into the seats of their workshops. They wanted to create a campaign that would show off all aspects of the unique opportunity they had to offer and excite people into participating. 
**The Solution**
Spark teamed up with Texture with Confidence to create a brand that stylists could recognize, trust, and really get behind. We worked to create a beautiful brand image that is recognizable and we attended some of the training sessions to capture footage that was used to create effective marketing materials. The culmination of our efforts was the creation of a wrap-up video, which premiered at the Building Inclusive Communities Event. Texture with Confidence program achieved an award-winning milestone as they received the Inclusive Community Champion Award, thanks in large part to the valuable assets provided by Spark.
**Company Assets**
Spark's assets shaped Texture with Confidence's brand and facilitated sharing with others. The design team dedicated their efforts to creating a logo that captures the brand's essence and aligns with its aesthetic. The final design is simple, clean, and authentic to Texture with Confidence. Brand guidelines accompanied the logo to ensure its proper usage and maintain consistency in campaigns across platforms. 
Sparks video team attended a few of the teaching sessions run by Texture with Confidence with the purpose of collecting videos that could be later used in marketing materials. They blended in seamlessly during the training and were able to shoot some incredible footage that really shows off Texture with Confidence, the skills being taught, and the mission they’re trying to share. From those videos Texture with Confidence was able to create quality content to use on their pages, as well as being able to pull images from stills in the video.

Written by **Madyson Kiepprien-Fraser**
_Reading time 3:04 minutes_
Welcome to the Spark Compass Blog! A place where we summarize the key takeaways from every episode and share some memorable behind-the-scenes moments.
This week’s episode features Pam Armstrong, a Marketing Placement Facilitator working for St. Lawrence College, who helped us navigate the tricky question of, “What is marketing?”. Since this is our first episode, we wanted to give Pam a massive thank you for the patience and good humour she showed during our film session. Thank you for being an outstanding professor, and for your enthusiasm in joining Spark Compass during your summer break!
#### WHAT IS MARKETING?
For many, marketing takes on its own meaning. Door to door sales or telephone pole posters are the most common scenarios that come to mind. For Pam, marketing is all about identifying the needs and wants of your consumer. Can your product fulfill a desire? Can your service solve a problem? If the answer is yes then congratulations! You’ve got a viable business idea. 
The second half of marketing is all about understanding the environment you’ll be occupying. Who are your competitors and do they share a similar audience to yours? Where are your consumers currently shopping and how can you grab their attention? Having an answer to these questions makes marketing your business easier, just be sure to always keep your consumer in mind with everything you do!
#### WHAT ARE THE FOUR P’S?
This is also known as the marketing mix and it’s a fundamental concept for marketers. 
The four p’s can be broken down into individual concepts that, when applied together, creates the secret sauce of any business, product, or service. 
* Price: How much does it cost and how will you get it into the hands of your customers?
 
* Place: Where will you sell your product and is it easily accessible to your customers?
 
* Promotion: Why is it the best option for your customers to purchase?
 
* Product: Consider everything from product design to packaging, will it appeal to your customers and fulfill a want, need, or challenge they’re experiencing?
 
We’ll cover the discovery of your four p’s in the following section!
#### KEY CONSIDERATIONS TO FINDING YOUR FOUR P’S
The final goal behind any business should be to know and delight your customers.
There’s another quick list of questions you should answer that can help establish what your four p’s will/should be:
* Who are your consumers?
 
* Where are your consumers?
 
* How will you satisfy your consumers?
 
* How can you keep your consumers coming back?
 
* What are your consumers saying about business?
 
In the end, everything always circles back to your consumers. Do your best to understand them and align your business accordingly. 
In the words of Pam, “What interests them should fascinate you.” 
#### WHAT’S THE DEAL WITH INTERNAL MARKETING?
Happy employees can quickly become the biggest advocate for your business. If they don’t believe in your business then they aren’t going to become your champions, and you’ll lose out on a valuable piece of marketing. Word of mouth also applies to your staff so it’s important to target and retain talented employees who are passionate about your business. 
When employees leave a company, there’s always the risk of your customers following them. This is where internal marketing can also come into play. By reaching out as a business rather than relying solely on a representative, you can build connections and familiarity with your customers that will encourage them to stay long after their usual representative has moved on. 
#### FINDING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES!
Some of Pam’s favourite resources for marketing include:
* LinkedIn Learning
 
* Business Incubators
 
* Funding Agencies
 
* Community Resources
 
* Post-Secondary Institutions
 
Depending on whether you’re hoping to learn more or have someone help with aspects of your marketing will change which resource is right for you. 
#### TO SUMMARIZE!
When asked to summarize our conversation in three points or less, this is what Pam had to say:
* Know your customers and delight them
 
* Think about the lifetime value of your customer
 
* Communicate meaningfully, even if it isn’t always perfect

**The Process**
The whole process starts with brand development and design, as the decisions made impact all downstream marketing and design decisions. We had several meetings with Vergie at the beginning of the process to help us understand her why, her values, and her dreams, and to help us get a handle on how these can be expressed visually. Caroline developed a wide selection of logo concepts from these initial conversations after in-depth research and mood boarding. After narrowing down the logo concept we explored colour schemes, shapes and typography options, and refined the logo design. All of this culminated in the final logo, based on Vergie’s signature, and a comprehensive brand style guide. 
While the branding process was underway, we coordinated with Vergie for a photoshoot, to capture the images we needed for the website, as well as for her professional use. Daniel and Caroline collaborated together to establish the style of the photography and did the shoot at the Centre for Behavioural Studies on St. Lawrence College Campus. Daniel edited the photos and narrowed the selection down with Vergie into the final photos.  
With the branding complete, we turned our focus to designing Vergie's new website. After understanding the objectives the website must be able to fulfil, we started designing the sitemap and wireframes to establish the information architecture. With these in place, we started the design process, building out a prototype of the website in Wix. Once the prototype was built, we identified the need to connect the site with the Jane App, a leading clinical software for private practices. We helped Vergie set up the Jane App, included her branding into her account, and connected the booking portal with her website.  
During the final stages of website development, Vergie requested that we design e-books, providing her with valuable content to share with her audience.

This month’s episode featured Jennifer Baker, a part-time professor at St. Lawrence College who also runs her own business surrounding social media strategies and content creation. Jennifer helped us navigate the tricky subject of content creation, it’s importance in marketing, and it’s impact on small businesses.
#### SO, WHAT IS CONTENT CREATION?
In a nutshell, content creation is a process centered around helping customers through their buyer journey. Unlike traditional marketing, content creation focuses on the fine balance between education, entertainment, and a hard sell. Content creation belongs to digital marketing, which is heavily reliant on social media platforms to host and deliver their messaging. 
Most businesses utilize something known as a content mix to diversify their posts and consistently engage their audience. The industry standard ratio for this mix is creating content that provides value to the audience (80%) or that helps sell your product (20%). 
There are four main types of content that can be used in a content mix and they are:
* Videos
 
* Photos
 
* Blogs
 
* User-generated content
 
When struggling to create meaningful content, Jennifer suggested a three step process to help guide the creative process. These steps are:
* Problem: What are the pain points of your audience?
 
* Solution: How does your product solve that pain point?
 
* Content: Combine those two answers to create meaningful content!
 
In the end, how you develop your content mix depends on the analytics and preferences of your audience. If something performs well or fails to perform at all, feel free to adjust and modify your content mix until you find the ratio that works best for your business. 
#### HOW DO TRENDS IMPACT CONTENT CREATION?
The answer to this question is that it depends. It depends on whether the trend can provide value to your business and your audience. It depends on whether you have time to participate in every single trend that pops across your social media feeds. Successfully recreating a trend may boost that specific post while it’s still popular. Ultimately, choosing to follow trends is completely up to you. 
#### DEVELOPING A PROCESS THAT WORKS BEST FOR YOUR BUSINESS
When it comes to planning out your social media content, there are a four helpful tips to keep in mind. Number one is to start simple. Try not to overwhelm yourself by being everywhere at once. Choose the platforms you feel most comfortable with and where you know your audience frequents. 
Number two, understand what message you want to convey. Marketers often use content pillars to guide this decision and to keep their content focused on the topics that matter. [Sendible](https://www.sendible.com/insights/content-pillars#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20social,popular%20with%20your%20online%20audience.) has a great article surrounding content pillars for anyone who wants to learn more about them. 
Number three is to know that done is better than perfect. It’s easy to get wrapped up in the details but failing to post gives your competitors an advantage and your audience a reason to turn their attention elsewhere. 
Finally, tip number four is to be honest. Being vulnerable with strangers is a scary idea but your audience will appreciate the honesty if you provide it. Fell ill and couldn’t package your products for delivery? Let your audience know instead of leaving them to wonder why their order hasn’t shipped yet. That’s just one example of honesty but it happens more often than you might think. 
#### MY CONTENT ISN’T WORKING, WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW?
The most common reason why content fails is because it doesn’t engage the audience. Wondering why nobody is commenting or liking your posts? Start asking your audience simple, easily answered questions to catch their attention. Putting your customer first can focus these questions and help to build a relationship with your audience. 
Another reason why your content is failing could be your choice of language. It’s easy to use industry-specific jargon and even easier to forget that not everyone knows what they mean. Start your content with plain and simple language. Once you’ve established your audience enough to know their preferences, then you can begin to evolve the language you use for your content.
#### IS THERE A RULE ABOUT REUSING CONTENT?
Yes! The unspoken rule of thumb is to repurpose your content by presenting it in a new and interesting way. Reused content should differ from the original in both style and delivery. Do not copy and paste your content. Never ever. Especially when managing different platforms, be mindful to modify reused content to fit the demands of each particular platform. 
Media platforms can be compared to different countries with each one more unique than the last. It’s important to understand these differences so you can readily adapt your content and increase your odds of success. Speaking the language of each platform will help algorithms to better understand your content and align it with an interested audience. 
#### TO SUMMARIZE IN THREE POINTS OR LESS
Content creation is all about the customer. Keeping them at the center of your marketing efforts is a key aspect of creating content that your audience will enjoy. If a piece of content won’t educate, entertain, or inspire your audience then it should be deleted. Think quality over quantity.

# [Meeting Your Ideal Customer with Bill Crowe](https://www.sparkslc.ca/blog-page/blog-post-title-two-srtps) 
 _https://www.sparkslc.ca/blog-page/blog-post-title-two-srtps_

Written by **Madyson Kiepprien-Fraser**
_Reading time 3:04 minutes_
Welcome to the Spark Compass Blog! A place where we summarize the key takeaways from every episode and share some memorable behind the scenes moments.
This week’s episode features Bill Crowe, a professor working at St. Lawrence College for the past 35 years. With his help, we explored what it takes to meet your ideal customers. Bill, if you’re reading this, then thank you for bringing your many years of experience to this episode!
#### WHAT’S A TARGET AUDIENCE AND WHY DO THEY MATTER?
When you market your business, who are you trying to reach? If you don’t know who you’re selling to or why they should buy from you, then it’s time to meet your ideal customer! A target audience allows you to understand the mentality of your customers, which can make your marketing strategies more efficient over time. 
Some quick steps to take before creating your target audience include:
* Analyzing market opportunities
 
* Researching markets interested in your product/service
 
* Use the 4 P’s to establish your marketing mix
 
* Manage your efforts and execute with precision
 
It’s important to understand your business and what it has to offer before investing time into a target audience.
#### WHAT’S THE DEAL WITH MARKETING SEGMENTATION?
Market segmentation allows you to break your audience into homogeneous groups. What’s homogeneous mean? In essence, it’s the process of grouping individuals together based on significant similarities. While B2C (business to consumer) groups focus on individuals, B2B (business to business) groups focus more on types of businesses when establishing their market segments. 
Once you’ve established your segments, it’s important to consider their values and needs, who you should be selling to and how you can reach them with your marketing. 
#### WHY SHOULD YOU IDENTIFY MARKET SEGMENTS THAT DON’T FIT YOUR BUSINESS?
Just because a segment doesn’t fit your business doesn’t mean you should ignore them outright. Why does that segment not suit your business? Is there a way you can catch their attention and loyalty? Will a new product or service provide the opportunity to engage them? 
Don’t discredit a market segment that seemingly doesn’t fit with your business, but you also shouldn’t spend time on a segment that won’t yield results. 
#### WHERE SHOULD YOU START WITH FINDING YOUR BEST CUSTOMERS?
The first step is research. Bill reports spending hours and hours on this step to create a solid foundation of understanding on your consumers. Once you’ve gathered enough research, you can begin segmenting them into likeminded groups. With all of that completed, it’s time to rank your groupings by order of priority and compatibility. 
When developing and maintaining your market segments, Bill provided personas to better categorize them. 
* Suspect: Consumers who might have a need for your product or service
 
* Prospect: Consumers who might have a need and the authority to act upon it
 
* Customer: Consumers who have already bought from you once before
 
* Advocate: Consumers who are a fan of your business and act as recurring revenue
 
Each persona should be approached differently to develop, maintain, or advance relationships with your customers. 
#### A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DEMOGRAPHICS AND PSYCHOGRAPHICS
Demographics is the study of human populations while psychographics is the study of mental traits. Having a firm understanding of both concepts can make your marketing more effective.
Examples of demographic information include:
* Age and Gender
 
* Ethnicity and Race
 
* Marital Status and Income
 
* Education and Employment
 
Examples of psychographic information include:
* Personality and Lifestyles
 
* Interests and Opinions
 
* Beliefs and Values
 
Having answers for demographic and psychographic data allows you to better understand the reasoning behind the purchase-making decisions of your consumers. 
#### HOW DOES TARGETING B2B VS B2C CHANGE YOUR MARKETING STRATEGY?
B2B and B2C consumers have differing priorities and preferences for making a purchase. B2B decisions are founded off of reason, focusing on what’s in it for them. B2C decisions are based on emotion and how a product/service makes them feel. 
#### TO SUMMARIZE IN THREE KEY POINTS OR LESS!
* Take time to research your consumers
 
* Segment your consumers into like minded groups
 
* Change up your strategy when marketing B2B or B2C

# [Your Digital Hub: The Strategy Behind Website Development with Katie Ross](https://www.sparkslc.ca/blog-page/pycblnd2kdzhmvqoifeex0k22e5zms) 
 _https://www.sparkslc.ca/blog-page/pycblnd2kdzhmvqoifeex0k22e5zms_

Did you miss this month’s episode? Or maybe you’re just looking for a short memory refresher? Either way, welcome to the Spark Compass Blog! A place where we summarize the key takeaways from every episode and share some memorable behind the scenes moments. 
This month’s episode featured Katie Ross, the Director of Business Development currently working for Mellow Brew Marketing, who helped us explore all things website.
#### IMPACT OF WEBSITES ON MARKETING 
You might be wondering what the connection is between a website and your marketing plan. The simple answer is that they often work hand in hand with one another. A website acts as the foundation for how your business is positioned and also serves as an information hub for potential consumers. 
Creating an efficient website can positively impact your marketing in the areas of:
* Brand awareness
 
* Clear messaging
 
* Strong first impressions
 
And much, much more! 
#### BENEFITS OF HAVING A WEBSITE
No matter what stage your business is in, it’s almost guaranteed that you can benefit from having a website. If you feel like your marketing has been inconsistent or you aren’t sure where to go with your branding, websites can be a great way of refocusing your attention. 
Often serving as a first point of contact with potential clients, websites can help define who you are, what you do, and how you do it. Having this information clearly listed on your website can be helpful for clients and for your own marketing purposes. 
While on set, Katie mentioned how we “do business with people we like”. Websites can be a hub for authenticity, consistency, and quality that potential customers look for in a business, boosting you along their qualifying process. 
#### WHAT STYLE OF WEBSITE DO YOU NEED?
This is a question only you can answer but a good place to start is by understanding what you need your website to do for your business. When considering the style of website you’ll need, ask yourself some functional questions:
* Does your website need to accept payments?
 
* Will you be scheduling through your website? 
 
* Do you plan on selling products on your website?
 
By asking yourself what your website needs to do and how it will support your business, finding your ideal website style becomes much easier!
#### CHECKLISTS AND MODIFICATIONS
When something isn’t going according to plan, it’s easy to make uninformed changes. The same can be said for an underperforming website. That’s why it’s important to set a strong foundation for your website before publishing it. A quick checklist you can use to guide you during the creation process is:
* Why are you doing what you’re doing?
 
* How are you doing it?
 
* Why are you doing it?
 
If these foundational questions are being answered somewhere on your website, then you’re off to a good start. But let’s say things aren’t going the way you’d hoped and some changes are needed. Everything starts with strategy so it’s important to audit your website before making any modifications. Review elements such as:
* Missing keywords
 
* Unnecessary text
 
* Complicated navigation
 
* Lacking answers to potential search queries
 
Once you’ve established any areas of change, give yourself time to review any modifications before publishing them. Katie advises stepping away for 60 days to give yourself time to live with the changes before making them permanent. 
And remember that when it comes to website content, less is more. 
#### ARE THERE STANDARDIZED WEB PAGES?
Yes and no! There’s no set standard to the world of website creation but there are certain pages that most customers have come to expect. These pages often contain valuable information about your business so they’re good to have on your website. These pages are:
* Home page
 
* About Us page
 
* Contact Us
 
Some nice to have but not always necessary pages include:
* Blank QR page
 
* Business Process page
 
* Product/Services page
 
Again, it’s important to consider what your business does and what you need your website to do for you when deciding which pages to include. 
#### TO SUMMARIZE
* Know your audience
 
* Know the purpose of your website
 
* Research website tools to create seamless interactions

# [User Experience with Veronica Dogbegah](https://www.sparkslc.ca/blog-page/blog-post-title-three-r2r9p) 
 _https://www.sparkslc.ca/blog-page/blog-post-title-three-r2r9p_

Written by **Madyson Kiepprien-Fraser**
_Reading time 2:32 minutes_
Welcome to the Spark Compass Blog! A place where we summarize the key takeaways from every episode and share some memorable behind the scenes moments. 
This week’s episode features Veronica Dogbegah, a User Experience Design Specialist working for SAP, who helped us explore the ever changing world of user experience. So, without further ado, what exactly is user experience?
#### DEFINING USER EXPERIENCE
Veronica described UX (user experience) as being the bridge between business goals and user needs. By requiring a deeper understanding of the consumer and their ever shifting lifestyles, businesses can anticipate their needs and act in a way that benefits both parties. While research and analysis serve as fundamental parts of UX, it’s also important to include empathy into your work. 
She further defines UX as not being an “us or them” scenario, but an “us with them” ideology. 
#### WHAT PRINCIPLES OF UX SHOULD YOU ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND?
There are four stages to user experience. Research, ideation, prototyping, and testing. While these are important aspects to UX, our conversation focused more on the human elements. When asked, these are the main principles of UX that Veronica always tries to keep in mind:
* Keep the user at the center of your design process
 
* Less is more, the user shouldn’t need your support for the end design
 
* Maintain consistency of functionality and features across all platforms
 
* Apply user testing as a means of validating your research
 
 * Just remember that user testing should be a continuous process and not a single use write-off
 
* By designing for accessibility and inclusion, you are designing for everyone
 
#### HOW DOES USER EXPERIENCE APPLY TO MARKETING?
UX begins with research and deviates towards the implementation of consumer feedback. By having an established understanding of your business, industry, and consumer, the process of pitching your product becomes much easier. Not only that, but the foundation of marketing aligns with UX research, which makes the process of marketing much simpler, too. 
An element of marketing your business falls into the experiential category. If consumers have a good experience, they’ll share positive word of mouth and be more likely to return in the future. If they have a bad experience, then they’ll tell twice as many people about it and be unlikely to return ever again. So UX not only makes marketing easier, it also creates a positive experience for your consumers that will keep them coming back in the long run. 
#### WHAT ARE SOME WAYS OF INCLUDING UX INTO MARKETING?
Veronica talked about taking a design thinking approach to her work. In short, a systematic approach to creative problem solving. Some of the ways she uses design thinking include:
* Identifying the overlap between user needs and business goals
 
* Understanding the environment, interactions, goals, and needs of the consumer
 
* Seeking internal feedback to provide additional perspectives to her design process
 
All of these points are a great resource for any business's marketing. We’ve already covered the importance of knowing your audience in a previous episode but once that information is known, it becomes much easier to market your business. 
#### TO SUMMARIZE IN THREE POINTS OR LESS!
* It’s our duty to make designs accessible to everyone.
 
* UX is not a one-time activity. Treat it like a lifestyle by integrating it into everything you do.
 
* It’s a human-centric approach to design thinking that focuses on the user every step of the way.

This month’s episode featured Laura Kittner, a professor in Digital Marketing Communications and Advertising Marketing Communications programs here at St. Lawrence College. She also runs her own agency and is very passionate about her field of work. In this month’s episode, Laura helped us explore all things digital advertising. 
#### WHAT IS DIGITAL ADVERTISING?
Initial impressions of digital advertising is that it’s a wild, crazy, and harried world. Despite that (or maybe because of it) digital advertising is also incredibly exciting and rewarding to participate in. 
When asked to describe digital advertising, Laura called it a “pay to play” experience. In short, digital advertising typically involves paying to have your message put in front of a particular audience. What sets digital advertising apart from traditional marketing is that it occurs entirely on screen. Websites, social media, email, podcasting, and more all fall into the category of digital advertising. 
It’s an accessible and iterative platform that allows you to experiment, pivot, and mold your approach however you’d please. Everyone has an opportunity to participate in digital advertising and see varying forms of success, regardless of budget or experience. Most digital advertising platforms have removed the learning curve by adding intuitive step-by-step guides for its users. By identifying your goals or objectives, these platforms can auto-generate and suggest what your next steps should be.  
Digital advertising can be intimidating for people running a small business or who aren’t technologically savvy. Hiring someone in the industry can help make the experience seamless but it isn’t necessary. Fortunately, digital advertising campaigns can always be modified and changed, so you’re never locked into a single decision or approach. 
#### FIRST STEPS WHEN STARTING A DIGITAL ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN
This is a common theme we’ve been seeing among our guest speakers but once again, a key aspect of starting a digital advertising campaign is knowing about your customers. If you missed it, one of our earliest episodes covers meeting your ideal customer. You can access that episode by [clicking here](https://www.sparkslc.ca/blog/2022/9/21/meeting-your-ideal-customer-with-bill-crowe). If you’re in a rush, here’s a summary of the things you should know about your customers to create a successful digital advertising campaign. 
* Who are your customers?
 
* Where are they spending their time online? 
 
* What social media platforms are they using?
 
* What are they doing while using these platforms?
 
Understanding your customers, their habits, and their behaviours will also allow you to target which platforms you should be using. One of the worst things you can do is to stretch your efforts across all social media platforms using the same generic content. This isn’t an efficient strategy and it’s also a waste of precious resources, including your time. 
So, get to know your audience and you can take things from there. 
#### TYPES OF DIGITAL ADVERTISING
There are dozens of different ways a business can use digital advertising. The ones mentioned during our podcast episode include:
Email Marketing
* This method has a low barrier to entry, lets you cultivate your audience, and build brand loyalty with existing customers over time.
 
Retargeting Ads
* Laura used Patagonia as an example to explain how this type of digital advertising works. Let's say you were on the Patagonia website to look at a fleece jacket. You might have even added it to your cart but never finished making a purchase. Patagonia could launch a retargeting campaign by using digital cookies to have ads for that particular jacket pop up every time you visit a new site or platform. Retargeting ads allow you to subtly nudge your customers into taking a specific action, which is most often making a sale on a product or service. 
 
Video Advertising
* Video is quickly becoming one of the most popular forms of advertising available. They can be run on virtually any device, across nearly every platform, and tend to outperform advertisements that are strictly image or text-based.
 
Search Engine Marketing
* This type relies on search engine queries. Organic search results are free and based on your SEO ranking to display your business in front of a searching customer. There’s also sponsored results which are displayed at the very top of search results. These are paid ads but are reliably shown above organic search results each time. 
 
#### CHOOSING THE RIGHT PLATFORM FOR DIGITAL ADVERTISING
When asking Laura to describe how businesses can choose the right platforms, her immediate response was to be selfish. Consider yourself first to set a base-level understanding of how you can better position your business. For this step, consider things like:
* Your product or service
 
* How do they help?
 
* Why do they matter to your customer?
 
It’s a noisy, crowded, and competitive landscape so you need to be clear about what you’re offering and how it will benefit your customer. This circles back to the importance of knowing your customers, and knowing them well. Again, things to consider include:
* Knowing who your customers are
 
* Knowing where they spend their time online
 
* Knowing what they do while online
 
* What do they value?
 
* What motivates them? 
 
Fortunately, most platforms are predictive and can generate expected results for your digital advertising campaign but the more information you have about your customers, the more accurate those predictions should be. 
#### A/B TESTING
This was a quick topic that came up in conversation with Laura, but we think it’s important to anyone’s understanding of digital advertising and will be covering it in a bit more detail. 
A/B Testing is the process of creating an advertisement based on interpretations of what your customers want to see. Then you make small tweaks to the original advertisement to make a second, nearly identical version. Common tweaks for the second ad include:
* Colour
 
* Imagery
 
* Wording
 
* Call to action
 
Then you run them both and see which performs the best. If they both perform the same, consider taking the best parts of both to create an entirely new ad! If one clearly outperforms the other, then keep the best one running and shut down the other. The possibilities are endless and the results usually speak for themselves. 
#### HOW TO IMPLEMENT DIGITAL ADVERTISING INTO MARKETING
This is broken down into a few key components. They are largely revolved around knowing why your business does what it does, and also knowing who your customers are:
* As a business, what are your goals and objectives?
 
* What do you want to accomplish with your digital advertising?
 
* Who are your customers and what do they expect from you?
 
Digital advertising can be a viable part of any marketing strategy. Depending on how you answered the above questions, digital advertising could play a big or small role in that strategy. Consider what makes the most sense for your business and whether a digital advertising approach will allow you to engage with your audience. 
At the end of the day, everything a business does is focused on its consumers. Digital advertising is no different, it just has a clearer focus on the behaviour, activities, and interactions of your customers than other aspects of your business. 
#### ECHO CHAMBERS
This was another quick but interesting topic that came up in conversation. Echo Chambers occur when platforms analyze your online behaviour and start showing content that’s similar to what you’ve previously interacted with. They’ll also start showing you paid content based on these analyzed behaviours to increase the odds of you interacting with an ad. 
Echo Chambers are aptly named for their tendency to echo back whatever you interact with on social platforms. This creates a content feedback loop intentionally designed to make you stay and use their platform for longer periods of time. 
#### TO SUMMARIZE DIGITAL ADVERTISING INTO THREE POINTS OR LESS
Accessibility 
* Digital advertising has a low barrier to entry and can also be low cost to operate.
 
Noisy 
* Anyone can use digital advertising, so it can be a crowded and competitive landscape that makes landing in front of your ideal customer challenging. 
 
Exciting 
* It’s a creative, forgiving, and viable tool to advertise your brand in a more humanized fashion.
 
#### FINAL WORDS OF WISDOM ON DIGITAL ADVERTISING
As we wrapped up our conversation, Laura left us with three final words of advice for anyone who wants to start implementing digital advertising into their marketing strategy.
* Just start and don’t overthink it
 
* Start small and expand from there
 
* Remember why you believed in your product/service in the first place

## Legacies Of Loyalist
#### **Oral history of Loyalist Township**
Loyalist Township has grown over the years, deeply rooted in its own history. Each hamlet, uniquely their own, is connected through their rich culture and vast history. Loyalist Township was granted an opportunity to undertake a project aimed at preserving and exploring its unique heritage and this is where our story begins.
**The Challenge**
Since Loyalist Township has such an abundant and rich history, it's crucial for the people who call it their home to continue to preserve that history as the years go on. On top of capturing their history, The township wanted to be able to share it with the new generations in a unique format that captivates the audience.
**The Solution**
Loyalist Township and Spark worked together to reach their goal through a documentary. They decided to create an oral history film, which allowed the people of Loyalist Township to connect on a personal level with their history. As Loyalist Township continues to evolve, this project provides a valuable opportunity to preserve and celebrate the rich heritage that connects each hamlet, ensuring that future generations can appreciate and learn from the community's vibrant history.
**Company Assets**
Our team embarked on a comprehensive journey to assist Loyalist Township in reaching its goal. Through extensive interviews, we engaged with five prominent figures deeply connected to Loyalist heritage, capturing their valuable insights and personal narratives. With three days dedicated to shooting, we meticulously documented the essence of Loyalists’ history, culminating in a captivating 60-minute documentary.
This in-depth documentary serves as a powerful asset to Loyalist Township. It will be shared across classrooms and museums, ensuring widespread accessibility and engagement. Immersed in the rich tapestry of Loyalists’ past, viewers will be deeply connected to the heritage and history of the township, forging a stronger sense of pride and connection to their community.
