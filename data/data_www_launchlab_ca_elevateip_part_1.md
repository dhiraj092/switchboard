# [V6: Sustainably Higher Yields through Fertilizer Innovation — Launch Lab — Launch Lab](https://www.launchlab.ca/client-stories/v6-sustainably-higher-yields-through-fertilizer-innovation) 
 _https://www.launchlab.ca/client-stories/v6-sustainably-higher-yields-through-fertilizer-innovation_

From precision agriculture to machine automation, the global farming industry continues to take on new technology to improve yield, increase sustainability and be more efficient with expensive resources. However digital technology and apps are only one side of the multifaceted story of innovation taking place in the farming industry.
As the pioneering V6 Agronomy (V6 Ag) team will remind you, farming is about producing food, a tangible process that produces tangible outputs, requiring continued innovation that supports a measurable increase in sustainable yield growth.
This is something V6 Ag has consistently delivered, producing high-efficiency precision fertilizers since 2018. Where precision agriculture meets precision fertilizers is a game-changer for farmers and their crops.
## **Precision Fertilizer through Custom Multivitamin-like Granules**
The need for high-efficiency precision crop nutrition is central for V6 Ag. The company has produced compound fertilizers that combine entire nutrient profiles into one granule. Their formulations follow Fertilizer Canada’s 4R Nutrient Stewardship principles, which advocate the Right source at the Right rate, Right time, and Right place. The 4R principles balance farmer, industry, and government goals to improve on-farm economics, crop productivity, and fertilizer efficiency while benefiting the environment.
By using high-density granules that combine a complete nutrient profile as opposed to a blended mix of separated nutrients, farmers can confidently fertilize their fields knowing all ingredients are distributed in the right proportions. The all-in-one composition of the granules has led to V6 Ag coining their products as the multivitamins of fertilizer. So far, the Eastern Ontario company has developed a portfolio of three flagship formulations customized for different crops and markets.  
**_"The results have been proven,”_** says Ryan Brophy, CEO of V6 Agronomy, **_“Our customers boast rapid and uniform seedling emergence with superior plant health and improved yields after switching to V6 Ag’s precision compound fertilizer."_**
## **Fertilizer for Environmental Sustainability and Reducing Emissions**
Beyond improving yields, V6 Ag’s patented formulas have been developed to support the sustainability of the farmland with a substantial decrease in salt composition and to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases like nitrous oxide, a common by-product of fertilizers.  
One key differentiator is V6 Ag’s ability to support the sustainable use of urea, a fertilizer of critical importance that is used around the world to raise nitrogen levels in soil and support plant growth.  Unfortunately, urea is highly prone to nitrogen loss into the atmosphere and water table.  These losses are not only detrimental to the environment but also to the crop’s yield potential and farmer’s bottom line.  
As a solution, many farmers have adopted the use of chemical stabilizers that effectively control nitrogen losses when applied to the urea before field application.  Although these products help to preserve nitrogen, they have proven to be detrimental to soil microbial health.  
V6 Ag has developed a patented mechanism that incorporates organic, mineral components into the base composition of the urea granule itself, rather than a coating. This invention has shown to be equal in its capacity to control nitrogen loss to the benefit of the grower and our environment while simultaneously supporting soil microbial health, remineralization, superior shelf life and product handling. V6 Ag will be producing this new urea source at its Ontario production facility once commissioned in 2026 and is presently in discussion with international manufacturers regarding licensing and production.
To validate these formulations, the company partnered with Trent University’s School of Environment on a multi-year soil health research project.  The goals were to leverage biological versus synthetic treatments to improve the microbial performance of the soil health, while at the same time encouraging increased carbon capture and the reduction of nitrous oxide emissions.  
V6 Ag left the project with a proven dry compaction granulation process that uses extreme force to press the necessary ingredients into a dense, water-soluble granule that their customers can conveniently store, ship and handle. 
## **Building a Solid IP Strategy**
Throughout the process, V6 Ag leveraged the Launch Lab team, with a specific focus on building a robust IP strategy. The organization knew their recipes and granulation process were pushing the boundaries of fertilizer innovation and wanted to ensure they were taking the right steps to bring the product to market.
Launch Lab started by connecting V6 Ag with Elevate IP, where there was a complete landscape analysis to pinpoint how their product is unique from other compound granular fertilizers. By understanding their product differentiators, the company was not only able to protect what made their solution innovative through patents but also sharpen their organization’s market fit as they prepared for commercial growth.
**_“The development of a strategic IP strategy and IP implementation is at the core of growth and innovation,”_** remarked Brophy.
**_“Launch Lab’s understanding of the importance of IP to a business portfolio, and the expert team has resulted in our company’s ability to put innovation at the forefront of all our research and development across our portfolios.”_**
As V6 Ag moves on to its next round of patent applications, their projections for growth and market evaluations have become clearer. In fact, sales revenue for the company is projected to grow tenfold within the next three years as the company moves from R&D to focus on scaling manufacturing for both domestic and global markets.
## **Ready to Disrupt the Global Farming Industry**
As farmers are looking to digital technology to improve automation and data-driven decision-making, they are also looking for more tangible innovations that will improve yield, maintain soil health, and support the environment.  V6 Ag is planning to deliver, looking in the short-term to target a 2% market entry, prove their worth to the early adopters and then become a staple in the future of crop farming.
**_“Looking ahead, we’re excited to continue our growth at both our Ontario and Saskatchewan locations, and developing fertilizer technologies for crops across Canada and beyond”,_** says Brophy. **_“We’ve really only scratched the surface of what enhanced efficiency fertilizers can do to improve soil health today to feed tomorrow.”_**

# [ScribeWire: Delivering the Human Connection in Media Accessibility  — Launch Lab](https://www.launchlab.ca/client-stories/scribewire-delivering-the-human-connection-in-media-accessibility) 
 _https://www.launchlab.ca/client-stories/scribewire-delivering-the-human-connection-in-media-accessibility_

Very few companies understand the immense transformation that media has undergone like Eastern Ontario’s ScribeWire. Originally created to support major Canadian broadcasting networks in 1994, ScribeWire has continually adapted to the ever-changing landscape of media consumption, from the height of TV and radio to the full maturity of the information age and the takeoff of online content growth.  
This has forced a duality of grounded pragmatism and visionary flexibility in ScribeWire’s service modelling. A balance led by CEO Brooke Woboditsch, a proud member of the Anishinaabe Indigenous community who inherited the company from her late father, Canadian broadcaster Larry Gavin. ScribeWire’s story is one of evolution alongside changing technologies and content needs, while never turning its back on what is most important in communication: the human connection.
## **Accuracy, Convenience, and Trust**
Media accessibility is not only a matter of legal compliance, it is crucial for expanding reach to audiences with varying abilities and diverse linguistic needs. Most automatic captioning and transcription tools fall short of media accessibility standards in terms of:
* Accuracy
 
* Cultural sensitivity
 
* Confidentiality and security
 
Ultimately limiting their effectiveness, creating barriers to inclusivity, and ultimately lowering interactions.
With over three decades in the market, ScribeWire has become a trusted go-to provider in full-spectrum media accessibility, offering high-quality services such as live captioning, CART, simultaneous interpretation, American Sign Language (ASL), described video, transcription, translation, and website accessibility audits for corporations, broadcasters, government agencies, and more. The common thread of this full portfolio is an emphasis on innovation combining expert human oversight, security, and user-centric design to ensure accuracy, compliance, and cultural sensitivity. As a Woman-led Indigenous business, the company is committed to enhancing media accessibility and ensuring equitable access for all, no matter the medium or the demographic.
Unlike competitors relying solely on automatic solutions, ScribeWire uses subject matter experts, ensuring precise and compliant accessibility. Recognizing the importance of understanding in communication, the company takes the human element one step further, connecting its clients with personnel that match things like accent, subject expertise, and cultural knowledge. Pairing this custom service with an efficient proprietary resource management system has made ScribeWire in demand across industry. 
## **Building on Three Decades of Supporting Media**
Of course, ScribeWire did not always have such a robust service offering.  In 1994, under the leadership of founder Larry Gavin, the company, then known as Closed Caption Services (CCS), set itself apart by combining human expertise with an innovative virtual business model. 
As online media became more popular and accessibility standards set a new bar in content requirements, CCS began expanding its services to meet the needs of post-production captioning, web captioning, and described video. The resulting growth in content and resources requiring support has led the company to develop a proprietary management system that centralized all project details including client assignments, live event schedules, video projects and client deadlines. Spurring this transformation was a passing of the baton in leadership from Larry Gavin to his daughter Brooke Woboditsch, who saw the shift in content consumption and wanted to make sure the company expanded to full-spectrum support for media accessibility. 
By 2018, 95% of ScribeWire’s business still came from broadcasting, but the company was primed to begin major market penetration into online accessibility services.  This positioning aligned fortuitously with the major shift to online work and communication during the COVID-19 pandemic.
**_“People started finding us for Film Festivals, town hall meetings, conferences and hybrid events,”_** reflected Woboditsch as she recounted the large wave of customers that flooded the company during the COVID-19 lockdown. _“_**_This surge in demand for live transcription services, especially as business pivoted online, allowed us to expand our offerings. We added capabilities to accommodate bilingual events with the addition of French and Spanish transcription and captioning. To offer a full-spectrum experience, we also incorporated simultaneous interpretation and American Sign Language (ASL), ensuring comprehensive access for all our clients.”_** 
Where the pandemic marked a turning point in media and communication needs, ScribeWire found a lasting source of demand for its services.  With the growth in live-streamed and hybrid events showing no signs of slowing, there has been a continued increase in work for live and post-production multi-lingual and ASL transcription service providers.
## **Integrating the Latest Technology with Human Expertise**
Not a team to become complacent, ScribeWire is looking to the next evolution in media accessibility services. **_“Currently many technology companies are focused on replacing humans as part of the service delivery and creating automatic technologies for captioning, transcription, interpretation, and translation,”_** confirms Woboditsch. **_“Companies relying on these technologies face significant limitations in terms of accuracy for some types of content, and there are also major concerns about the security of proprietary information.”_** 
ScribeWire is addressing these challenges by integrating cutting-edge tools, including AI where appropriate, to support rather than replace human expertise.   
These tools assist with tasks like automating the generation of first-pass transcription and caption files, incorporating custom dictionaries, automating corrections in speech recognition, creating format templates, and creating a more efficient human review process. The approach allows ScribeWire to bring cost-effective services that meet high standards for accuracy.
The company is also developing a centralized customer portal that has the potential to become a built-in accessibility department for audiovisual companies, large event management firms, and post-production houses, seamlessly complementing their services by keeping ScribeWire’s offerings custom to customer needs and connecting the right resources for each job.
This full solution model is a major win for their clients, who are required to meet a variety of accessibility regulations like ACA, AODA, and WCAG, which often require multiple specialized suppliers.
## **Capitalizing on Momentum for Continued Growth**
As leader of ScribeWire, Woboditsch is quick to speak on the exciting and trying path of entrepreneurship, “Taking over ScribeWire, was like flying an airplane with no training.  At first, it was daunting navigating both the company and the rapidly changing media landscape. But step by step, we embraced innovation and built a future-forward company that continues to adapt, ensuring our services remain cutting-edge and meet the evolving needs of our clients.”
Throughout this experience, Woboditsch reached out to a plethora of support networks for Canadian startups, participated in multiple accelerator programs, and worked closely with Launch Lab Advisor Judith Pineault, who connected her with many other entrepreneurs to share experiences and knowledge on how to successfully grow a business.
Woboditsch, quick to express the value in connecting with fellow entrepreneurs for advice and feedback, also exalts wisdom from her own experience, **_“Understand your market, and ensure your solution addresses real, ongoing needs while being adaptable to future challenges. Stay agile and always be on the lookout for opportunities.”_** A way of thinking that has led ScribeWire to continued success through the past thirty years. 
Most recently, ScribeWire leveraged Launch Lab’s [Digital Lead Generators (DLG) Team](https://www.launchlab.ca/digital-lead-generators) to support the launch of its rebrand and new digital footprint. DLG played a pivotal role in helping plan and execute the public launch through email campaigns, Google and LinkedIn Ad campaigns, and a targeted social media strategy.  This has supported the company’s realignment with the current technology landscape and will be foundational in continuing to scale ScribeWire’s customer base. 
**_“Launch Lab has been instrumental in helping us navigate the complexities of rebranding and digital transformation,” remarked Woboditsch. “Their support, especially through the DLG team, has been invaluable in aligning our technology and marketing efforts to scale ScribeWire’s customer base.”_** 
## **Keeping Human Connection in Media Accessibility**
As ScribeWire continues to scale, it is looking to enter new markets, with specific interest in corporate, educational, and government sectors. To get there, the ScribeWire team is focused on building proprietary systems to better serve their clients with a full suite of accessibility solutions. From transcription to described video to website audits, ScribeWire has committed their services to combining the best human expertise for the job with the best cutting-edge technology.  
It is clear that under Brooke Woboditsch’s leadership, ScribeWire will not lose sight of what makes it such a valuable organization. Acknowledging that media accessibility and trusted communication accuracy come from more than auto-transcription, it includes the understanding of the expert, cultural, and regional knowledge needed by the client that can only be fulfilled by a human connection.
**_“As we look ahead, ScribeWire will continue to push the boundaries of media accessibility, not just through cutting-edge technology but by fostering meaningful partnerships and staying rooted in our mission: to make media accessible, one line at a time.”_**
