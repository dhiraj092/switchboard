3. Store Records
Records and documents that are no longer used frequently can be placed in secure storage in the interests of saving office space.  When storing **hardcopy records** on campus, do not store boxes in areas where they may be insecure, where they may be moved without the unit’s knowledge, or where they could be exposed to hazards such as water or pests.
**Electronic records** with a long or permanent retention period should be retained on the University's network so that they are maintained through system upgrades and do not become unavailable due to software or hardware obsolescence. They should not be stored on removable media—such as USB drives, or external hard drives—which are easily lost and thus present a security problem, or over time become corrupted and unreadable.
## Offsite Storage
The University’s preferred supplier for offsite records and document storage is Iron Mountain. Your unit's Records Management Contact will have access to the Iron Mountain Connect online portal to facilitate the pick up and retrieval of your records boxes. If you are unsure of who your unit's Records Management Contact person is, please contact the [Records Manager](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/contact-us "Contact Us"). 
### **Move Records to Iron Mountain**
​Contact the Records Manager **before** you start to prepare your records for transfer. The Records Management and Privacy Office now scans your boxes in order to pre-populate the inventory sheet, then sends that pre-populated form to you.
Users will then fill out the remaining required fields of the transfer form and submit the it to the Records Manager for final review. Once the spreadsheet has been approved the Records Manager will send it to Iron Mountain and notify you that a pick up can be arranged using IM Connect.
_Note that only records that have a disposal date under an authorized [records retention schedule](https://archives.queensu.ca/records-retention-schedules) should be moved to offsite storage._

### **Order Boxes**
Hardcopy records are usually stored in 1.2 cubic-foot boxes (also known as bankers boxes). Boxes with pre-printed barcodes can be ordered directly from Iron Mountain.

**Notes:** The courses chosen must not duplicate work already completed either in university or pre-university study. If a student enters the program with advanced language/grammar knowledge or speaks Spanish at the near-native level, the student is exempted from taking the language and grammar courses (Span P10- SPAN 205). These would be replaced with courses from the option courses lists A and/or B.
Some courses in the SLAS Option courses list B may or may not cover topics directly involving Spanish and Latin American Studies, although students may approach instructors to see if assignments or papers could be written from this perspective.
SLAS is an interdisciplinary Plan and can be completed by taking course from other subjects.  Students can take a variety of courses, depending on what else they are studying, where their interests lie and where they already have the prerequisites for higher level study.

## Overview
The Department of Global Development Studies (DEVS) offers a suite of interdisciplinary programs that empower students to engage and influence the driving forces of global change. From questions of poverty and inequality, through to economic integration, environmental sustainability and cultural revitalization, our students address key global challenges and develop the practical skill sets required to make the world a better place. Our unique blending of big-picture analysis with practical problem-solving approaches opens a wide range of career choices and options for further study with graduates pursuing diverse fields from government and policymaking through to law, journalism, social enterprise and beyond.
The Department offers [Major](https://www.queensu.ca/academic-calendar/arts-science/schools-departments-programs/global-development-studies/global-development-studies-major-arts-ba-honours/), [Joint Honours](https://www.queensu.ca/academic-calendar/arts-science/schools-departments-programs/global-development-studies/global-development-studies-medial-arts-ba-honours/), [Minor](https://www.queensu.ca/academic-calendar/arts-science/schools-departments-programs/global-development-studies/global-development-studies-minor-arts/), and [General](https://www.queensu.ca/academic-calendar/arts-science/schools-departments-programs/global-development-studies/global-development-studies-general-arts-ba/) plans of study. Students enter the plan in second year and will follow a 200-level curriculum focused on foundational courses that establish the key building blocks for development studies as a field. Topic courses at the 300-level facilitate a broadening of perspectives and a deepening of knowledge. Topic courses at the 400-level for [Major](https://www.queensu.ca/academic-calendar/arts-science/schools-departments-programs/global-development-studies/global-development-studies-major-arts-ba-honours/) and [Joint Honours](https://www.queensu.ca/academic-calendar/arts-science/schools-departments-programs/global-development-studies/global-development-studies-medial-arts-ba-honours/) students offer the opportunity for students to specialize in a topic that is led by a leading expert in the field within a seminar setting.
## Special Study Opportunities
### Summer Semester at the University of Witwatersrand, South Africa
DEVS has partnered with the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa to offer a six-week summer semester abroad taking place from July to August. This unique study-abroad opportunity at a world-class university gives students the chance to choose two seminar-level courses on topics covering diverse aspects of contemporary African society and development. In addition, there is also a guided series of weekly cultural activities in-and-around the city of Johannesburg with Queen’s and South African instructors. Lastly, there is a weekly reading course with the other students on South African literature.
Students earn a total of 6.00 DEVS undergraduate credits for successfully completing the summer semester program at WITS. Enrolment in the summer semester requires students to have completed [DEVS 363](https://www.queensu.ca/academic-calendar/search/?P=DEVS%20363 "DEVS 363") or permission of the department. Ancillary fee is estimated to be $1,500 for the program fee and accommodation. Accommodation is provided in a secure, self-catering centre on campus. Food, flight, and transportation costs are not included, and students are required to make sure they have appropriate health insurance. Applications are open to third year and above students in good standing and are due in early January. The relevant forms will be made available through the Global Development Studies Department website in December [http://www.queensu.ca/devs](http://www.queensu.ca/devs)
### Semester in Shanghai
Courses taken in the **[Queen’s Semester in Shanghai program](http://www.queensu.ca/ipo/outgoing-students/semester-shanghai)** offered through the International Programs Office are pre-approved as option courses in DEVS Plans. 
### Global Action and Engagement Certificate (GAEN)
Are you planning to work or volunteer internationally and require a strong grounding in the tools of ethical, responsible and sustainable engagement? This fully online Queen’s certificate could be perfect for you! Based on the principles of reflexive cross-cultural communication and sustainable partnership building, the GAEN Certificate provides action-orientated approaches that help to ensure productive global engagements. This makes GAEN an ideal choice for students working in the fields of health, engineering, social enterprise, and international development work.
The certificate will comprise of 18.00 units of undergraduate courses, including 15.00 units of core courses and 3.00 units selected from several option courses. Global Engagement ([DEVS 280](https://www.queensu.ca/academic-calendar/search/?P=DEVS%20280 "DEVS 280")) is the culminating course centered on active, collaborative, and self-reflexive modes of learning. It will lead students to reflect upon and unpack previous experiential learning activities that have taken place in the context of global development, while preparing them for future global engagement. Note only 9.00 units from the GAEN certificate can be counted towards your degree program.
### Independent Work Study Abroad Program:
##### [DEVS 410](https://www.queensu.ca/academic-calendar/search/?P=DEVS%20410 "DEVS 410") **and** [DEVS 411](https://www.queensu.ca/academic-calendar/search/?P=DEVS%20411 "DEVS 411")
One of the most attractive features of the Global Development Studies program at Queen's is the opportunity it affords students to complete a placement in a development context and get hands-on field experience for credit. Many of our students maintain that their placement is the highlight of their academic career. The experience-based learning within a [DEVS 410](https://www.queensu.ca/academic-calendar/search/?P=DEVS%20410 "DEVS 410") internship courses refines practical skills for the workplace and enhances cross-cultural understanding and communication skills while helping students understand the role of history and power in shaping the global world. Students have travelled to places such as Bangladesh, Bolivia, China, Costa Rica, Laos, Ghana; have worked with organizations such as United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Oxfam, Shastri, Polaris Institute, World Bank, Canada World Youth, SOS Children's Village, Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity; and have been engaged with projects as diverse as AIDS education, land erosion prevention, human rights, and new immigrants to Canada.
The placement itself (6.00 units) usually takes place over the summer months following completion of the third year of study but requires pre-departure training in the Winter Term. [DEVS 410](https://www.queensu.ca/academic-calendar/search/?P=DEVS%20410 "DEVS 410") is not considered complete until the co-requisite Post-Placement Seminar (3.00 units) course is completed in the following Fall Term.
Enrolment in the [DEVS 410](https://www.queensu.ca/academic-calendar/search/?P=DEVS%20410 "DEVS 410") and [DEVS 411](https://www.queensu.ca/academic-calendar/search/?P=DEVS%20411 "DEVS 411") program is through an application process. Application forms are available through contacting the Global Development Studies Placement Coordinator at [devs.ugchair@queensu.ca](mailto:devs.ugchair@queensu.ca) or on the Department website  [www.queensu.ca/devs](http://www.queensu.ca/devs). Very limited funds are available through an application process to support internships, but in general, students are responsible for all costs.

# [Procedural Fairness | Office of the University Ombudsperson](https://www.queensu.ca/ombuds/appeal-process/procedural-fairness) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/ombuds/appeal-process/procedural-fairness_

## Student Rights and Responsibilities
Faculty communication along with many University policies and procedures reference student rights and responsibilities but the meaning behind it is often confusing. In most cases, in the context at the University, the student’s right is in reference to the right to procedural fairness in any academic decisions across the University, along with the student’s right to appeal any academic decision (assuming the grounds for appeal are met).
[Appeal processes](https://www.queensu.ca/ombuds/appeal-process/appeal-process "Appeal Process") were developed to reconsider the appropriateness of any sanctions or penalties that may have been imposed upon a student.
Students have a responsibility to familiarize themselves with the [Senate Student Academic Appeals Policy (SAAP)](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/senate/student-academic-appeals-policy) , as well the specific academic regulations from their home Faculty. The SAAP policy in particular includes reference to resources for students and the responsibilities and authority of Faculty and Schools.
## Procedural Fairness
Helping to ensure procedural fairness in decision making across the University is one of the central roles of our office. It relates to the **steps** taken by the decision maker **before** and **after** making a decision or responding to an appeal.
_Procedural fairness has four major components:_
**1. The right to know the case against you 
2. The right to an impartial decision maker 
3. The opportunity to have your views considered by the person or people making the decision 
4. The right to a decision and the rationale for that decision**
**Notice**
**Information**
**Right to Respond**
**Impartiality**
**Reasons**
Advance notice of consideration of a decision must be given to the student.
Student must have access to the information that is being considered.
Student must be given a meaningful opportunity to have their opinion considered.
The decision maker must be impartial and appear to be unbiased.
The decision maker must give meaningful reasons for the decision or the outcome.
\*Information has been adapted from the [ACCUO](http://accuo.ca/) Fairness Guide 2015

##### Queen’s University is situated on traditional Anishinaabe and Haudenosaunee Territory. To acknowledge this traditional territory is to recognize its longer history, one predating the establishment of the earliest European colonies. It is also to acknowledge this territory’s signiﬁcance for the Indigenous peoples who lived, and continue to live, upon it –people whose practices and spiritualities were tied to the land and continue to develop in relationship to the territory and its other inhabitants today. The Kingston Indigenous community continues to reﬂect the area’s Anishinaabek and Haudenosaunee roots. There is also a signiﬁcant Métis community and there are First Peoples from other Nations across Turtle Island present here today.

**AGHE 800 Evaluating Aging-Related Programs and Services**      
This course introduces learners to evaluation principles and practice as applied to programs that address social, physical and economic determinants of wellness and participation for older adults. Learners will acquire skills necessary to identify and apply program evaluation methods to inform ongoing program development. Topics will include theoretical aspects of program evaluation, as well as strategies for program development, monitoring and change with a focus on participatory approaches. Current debates in the field will be discussed, with particular attention to issues underlying research and evaluation with older adult populations in community and institutional contexts. Attention will be given to knowledge mobilization strategies that foster inclusion, empowerment and innovation. Winter.  
**AGHE 802 Ethics and Aging** 
This course will explore ethical issues arising in the wellbeing and care of aging adults. Aspects of three streams of ethics will be addressed: professional ethics, organizational ethics, and biomedical ethics, as these streams relate to wellbeing and aging. Issues that will be addressed include: the organizational importance placed on aging adults, moral distress, advance directives, consent, values, and the ethics of wellbeing. Fall. 
EXCLUSION: RHL-930 Ethical Issues in Rehabilitation and Health Leadership 
**AGHE 803 Demography and Geography of Aging**      
This course surveys the latest literature on the demography and geography of aging highlighting the latest census and survey data from Statistics Canada and international sources. Attention is placed on the underlying demographic factors and socio-economic characteristics of population aging and how issues like fertility, mortality, morbidity, life expectancy, mobility and immigration are changing the demography of the older population in Canada and internationally. Emphasis is also placed on how demographic and socio-economic characteristics of population aging result in complex and uneven geographies of aging at various scales from neighbourhood to international comparisons. Fall. 
**AGHE 804 Health and social systems for older adults**      
Health and social systems for older adults are amongst the most complex in many societies. They include parts or all of the primary care, acute care, chronic care, palliative care and home care systems, and rehabilitation services on the health provision side. On the social systems side, they include parts of the transportation, social housing, social work and legal systems. The complexities of health and social systems for older adults are the foci of this course and are examined through a review of the literature mainly with an emphasis on the health and social systems for older adults in Canada. Summer.
**AGHE 810 Epidemiology of Aging**      
Students are introduced to an overview of the core principles central to the epidemiology of aging, with an emphasis on health and disease processes in older adults. Essential epidemiologic design/analytic issues and common themes of age-related factors and disease are addressed. Topics include: definition and measures of disease, application of cohort and experimental studies to aging, bias and confounding arising from the process of aging, causal inferences, and special topics on aging. Winter.

# [Research Commercialization: Fostering the Translation of Academic Work to Commercial Success](https://www.queensu.ca/innovationcentre/research-commercialization-fostering-translation-academic-work-commercial-success) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/innovationcentre/research-commercialization-fostering-translation-academic-work-commercial-success_

Read on for more about the DDQIC’s efforts to translate academic work to commercial success. 
Invention to Innovation whitepaper reveals an urgent need to train researchers in commercialization: 
The DDQIC recently worked with Mitacs and Invention to Innovation (i2I) to publish a whitepaper on their commercialization post-doctoral fellowship. The study identifies a need to train three types of scientists in research commercialization; industry champions, venture founders, and translational scientists. The fellowship is designed for STEM and health researchers with work exhibiting commercial potential and a strong likelihood of societal impact. The programming ladders into existing Mitacs training, focusing not only on the venture, but also the industry, and the scientist. 
“i2I forces you to think about your research by taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture. It has a permanent influence on how I consider research. Now, whenever someone gives me a suggestion or an idea, I think first about where it is going to go. It is helping shape the entrepreneurial mindset that we’ve been talking about, and I found that super helpful.” - Mitacs Elevate Fellow, 2017-19 
New Faculty Innovation Fellows Program Pilot: 
The DDQIC facilitated the first faculty innovation fellows' program, which condenses the eight-month asynchronous i2I program into a one-week format for faculty members. The Pilot took place in the Donald Gordon Conference Centre in Kingston, Ontario, from May 13th-17th. 
The inaugural faculty cohort came from a diverse range of schools and disciplines, including Western University, University of Waterloo, Simon Fraser University, University of Northern British Columbia, and Queen’s University. The cohort received lectures on topics ranging from artificial intelligence and biotech to financial literacy and business modelling. A huge thank you to Nancy Ross from VPR, Sarah Lubik from Simon Fraser University, Francesco Matteucci, an i2I alumnus, Andrew Park from Trinity Western University, Clay Braziller from Simon Fraser University, Fabiano Armellini from Polytechnique Montréal, as well as Greg Bavington and James McLellan, Directors of the DDQIC, for their valuable insights over the course of the week. 
Entrepreneurship in Academia Ignition Café: 
In partnership with Vice-Principal Research and the Resources for Researchers at Queen’s (R4R@Q), the DDQIC hosted our June Ignition Cafe, focusing on entrepreneurship in academia. The goal of the gathering was to demystify the challenges of entrepreneurship and encourage academics of all fields to blend entrepreneurship into their professional journeys. The first portion of the event was led by DDQIC directors James McLellan and Gregory Bavington, focusing on the innovator's mindset and use-inspired research. The second portion of the event was a panel where faculty members could share their personal innovation journeys. Thank you to Fabio Ynoe de Moraes, Joshua Marshal, Stephen Brown, and Anh Tran-Ly for your insights and participation. 
CREATE grant for James McLellan’s PLASTICS programming: 
Congratulations to DDQIC director James McLellan on receiving the NSERC CREATE grant from the Government of Canada. Queen’s is investing in new training programs for highly qualified students and postdoctoral fellows. James McLellan will be working on developing the PLASTICS program (Plastic Affordance through Science and Technology Innovation for Circular Solutions). The program will provide training and skills crucial to the clean biotech industry, laddering into Mitacs, Simon Fraser’s i2I, and DDQIC programming. 
The Dunin-Deshpande Queen's Innovation Centre (DDQIC) is dedicated to fostering innovation and entrepreneurship among students and the wider community. Through various programs and initiatives, DDQIC supports the development of entrepreneurial skills and provides resources for aspiring entrepreneurs to succeed.

2. Appealing an Academic Integrity Decision
 [Appealing an AI Decision (234KB | PDF)](https://www.queensu.ca/ombuds/sites/ombwww/files/uploaded_files/TipSheets/AcademicIntegrity_Appealing_a_Decision.pdf)
Queen’s students, faculty, and staff all have responsibilities, through the [Senate Policy on Academic Integrity](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/senate/academic-integrity-policy) for supporting and upholding the fundamental values of academic integrity: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility and courage. The [Senate Policy on Academic Integrity Procedures](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/senate/academic-integrity-procedures-requirements-faculties-schools) outlines certain procedural requirements of Faculties & Schools surrounding any investigation into an academic integrity concern. While there are slight variances between Faculties & Schools all students must have an opportunity to appeal an academic integrity decision, should they meet the grounds.
**What can be appealed?** Students may appeal the finding, the sanction, or both.
[Review Section 4 (Appeals) of the **Academic Integrity Procedures – Requirements of Faculties**](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/senate/academic-integrity-procedures-requirements-faculties-schools)
The grounds for submitting an appeal are limited to cases in which a student is able to establish:
1. A breach of procedural fairness, which could include such things as failing to:
 * Permit a student to be heard by an unbiased decision-maker.
 * Follow applicable rules, regulations, or university policy in a way that adversely affected a student’s right to a fair process.
 * Make a reasonable decision. A “reasonable” decision is one that is rational in that its findings are based on evidence, thought out and supported by facts and logical inferences from findings of fact. To be reasonable, the decision must contain adequate reasons for the conclusions. A decision should not be overturned if it falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes. If the decision is “reasonable”, the decision-maker deciding the appeal is not permitted to substitute their opinion for that of the decision-maker whose decision is under appeal. 
  
2. The decision-maker whose decision is being appealed acted without, or exceeded their, jurisdiction. (e.g. an instructor imposes a sanction which is only available to the School AI Lead, such as a requirement to withdraw.)
Each Faculty or School regulation or procedure with respect to academic integrity matters sets out their own levels of appeal. In addition to the level(s) of appeal within each Faculty or School, the **[Senate Student Academic Appeals Policy](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/senate/student-academic-appeals-policy)** establishes the University Student Appeal Board (USAB), with jurisdiction to hear appeals of the final academic integrity decision made within each Faculty or School. Generally, the appeal levels are as follows\*:
**Original Decision Maker**
 
**Appeal Body**
**Instructor**
**Faculty/School AI Lead 
_ie. Associate Dean_**
**Faculty/School AI Lead 
_ie. Associate Dean_**
**Faculty/School AI Panel**
**Faculty/School AI Panel**
**University Student Appeal Board (USAB)**
_\*Students should refer to their Finding of Departure notice and must review the academic integrity policy for their Faculty or School for more detailed information on the next appropriate appeal level._
If you are confident your appeal does indeed meet one of the **grounds** for appeal, you will need to submit your appeal within **10 business days** of the date that the _Finding of Departure_ form was e-mailed by the decision-maker. If a decision on remedy or sanction was referred to the AI Lead the appeal cannot be submitted until a remedy or sanction is assigned. In such cases, the appeal must be submitted within 10 business days of the date that the notice of the remedy or sanction imposed was emailed to the student by the AI Lead.
The submission of the appeal generally includes the following\*:
* A copy of the Finding of Departure form that states the remedy or sanction decision
* A written appeal letter explaining the reasons for your appeal and the ground(s) for appeal
* Any additional supporting documents
If the appeal contains new evidence that is permitted, the appeal decision-maker shall have no jurisdiction over the appeal and shall send the matter back to the previous decision-maker for reconsideration, unless:
* the delay of sending the matter to the prior decision-maker would be unduly prejudicial to the student; or
* the student’s new evidence clearly demonstrates bias in the prior proceeding that otherwise cannot be remedied.
_Students should refer to the academic integrity policy for their Faculty or School for more detailed information on submitting the appeal._
This letter is not a re-telling of the case, but your opportunity to identify what was faulty in the process followed by the previous decision-maker(s).
**Introduction**
Consider your audience and provide an short opening introduction that summarizes your concern. This section should state clearly whether you are appealing the finding, the remedy or sanction, or both. A meeting is part of this process, but you may indicate you do not want to meet, and proceed based on written submissions only.
**Grounds for Appeal**
This section should provide a clear and concise explanation that summarizes **what** the reason(s) for appeal are and also clearly identifies the ground(s) for your appeal.
Your appeal letter should begin by saying what you’re appealing and provide a brief summary as to what the **ground(s)** are. Note that you will go into more detail when speaking about the underlying facts you have to support the ground(s).
For example, if you decide to appeal because you feel there was a breach of procedural fairness, you would say _“I am appealing the academic integrity finding and sanction that resulted in my grade of zero on the grounds of a breach of procedural fairness,”_ and then briefly explain what was the breach of procedural fairness. Ensure you review the flip-side of this document to understand what a breach of procedural fairness could include.
**Underlying Facts**
This section would detail the facts that support the ground(s) of appeal that have been identified. This can be thought of as the **“how”** of the appeal letter. For example, if a breach of procedural fairness occurred due to a biased decision-maker, you would include the facts that support **how** the decision-maker was biased in making the decision.

Rocky Horror Picture Show isn’t a film you can watch at home on your computer, it must be experience in person, with a theater full of people who have a passion for the film.
* [Free Self-Guided Walking Tours](https://www.visitkingston.ca/walking-tours/film/): I have a furry family member named Charlie (who many of you have met) and we love to walk! This fall, we hope to try some of Kingston’s Free Self-Guided Walking Tours including Film, Literary, and Music Tours. As a Ph.D. student in the Film and Media Department I am planning to start with the Film Tour to learn a little more about my department’s history. And since it is October, I am looking forward to hearing how Dan Aykroyd’s great-grandfather’s séance in Kingston during the 1920’s inspired the movie, Ghost Busters. Of course, we will watch the movie following the tour!
* [Fruition Berry Farm:](https://www.fruition.ca/serviceslist) Last October, Q Move Crew and SGSPA took a school bus full of grad students to Fruition Berry Farm. It felt just like a school field trip, and it was just as fun! I came home covered in mud with a large $10 bouquet of sunflowers. It is a Queen’s memory I will always cherish. The farm offers good, wholesome, fall fun including wagon rides, pumpkin picking and their legendary corn maze. This year’s corn maze is full of CORNnections puzzles which are word puzzles that must be solved at each check point. The farm is a 20-minute drive from Kingston, is open Saturdays and Sundays from 10am to 4 pm until October 27th. Last admission is at 3:30 PM. The cost is affordable at $6 per adult or $3.50 for groups of 15 or more.
* [Waddell Apples - Orchard & Farm Store](https://www.waddellapples.ca/): Picking apples sounds like the perfect fall afternoon activity. You can Pick Your Own Apples, with medium bags (holding over 10 lbs) available for $20, and large bags (holding over 20 lbs) for $40. Between the store and the Pick Your Own Apples, they have 15 varieties of apples available including many unique ones such as Lobo, Shamrock, Sweet Tango, Cortland, Empire, Macoun, Liberty, Crimson Crisp, Idared and Nova Spy.  Their local farm store is in an 1830’s log cabin and has a many of my favorite fall treats including, Apple Fruit Leather, Fresh Pressed Apple Cider, Apple Pie and Butter Tarts. Yum! Waddell Apple Orchard is a 20-minute drive from Kingston and is open daily 10am -4 pm.
Whether you’re catching a spooky movie, getting lost in a corn maze, or picking the perfect apple, bundle up and enjoy all that Kingston has to offer this fall.

# [Master of Public Administration (MPA)](https://www.queensu.ca/sps/study-here/mpa) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/sps/study-here/mpa_

1. Study Here
2. Master of Public Administration (MPA)
The **Queen's MPA** is a one-year, multi-disciplinary program for full-time students. The program has been preparing students at the entry and mid-career levels for leadership roles in public service and policy-making for more than thirty-five years. Graduates hold positions as ministers and senior officials in all three levels of government, as well as providing leadership in hospitals, community organizations and national associations across Canada.
The program's emphasis is on public policy, and the broad social, economic and political context within which public organizations operate. The program aims to develop policy leaders. Policy leadership requires skills in policy analysis and the capacity to implement new solutions. Policy and management are clearly interdependent. Without an understanding of the basic purposes that public organizations seek to achieve through policy, management is an empty process. Without the management skills to translate commitment into action, policy goals are empty promises.

## Extended Learning Beyond the Classroom
At Queen’s School of Policy Studies, we believe in the value of experiential learning and strive to incorporate the practical application of skills as a major component of the learning experience. During orientation, we immersed our students in Kingston’s policy world. For two days, students explored some of the challenges that the City of Kingston faces, showcased some of the amazing innovations and forward thinking taking place here and gained insights into how governing institutions work at a municipal level.
From meeting with the Mayor to the Deputy Chief of Kingston Police Force and the Warden of Collins Bay Institution, students also get to observe different styles of leadership.
Study tours are invaluable learning experiences that enrich policy studies and benefit students in many ways. For our graduates to be effective in the workforce, they need not only strong policy skills, but also a keen awareness of how policy interventions require collaboration across public, private and voluntary sectors. The study tour program is multidisciplinary and experiential, bringing together elements of culture, economics, politics, finance, and management. It encourages students to be directly involved in a learning experience rather than being recipients of ready-made content in the form of lectures. These experiences outside the classroom are integrated with the goals and objectives of our policy curriculum. Outcomes for students include personal growth, a broadening of personal perspective and empathy with respect to different sectors, and even better performance in regular academic settings.
### Study Tour Program Objectives are to:
* Broaden horizons – immerse students in a new policy environment; hear different perspectives; share observations and thoughts, and be open to new ideas and attitudes
* Develop Cross-sectoral Intelligence: the ability to look at policy issues from different sectoral perspectives and a deeper understanding of policy interdependence between the public, private and voluntary sectors
* Understand better how decisions are made and things get done
* Discover how governing institutions operate within a municipal, provincial and federal environment
* Observe styles of leadership
* Build confidence and learn to value the skills and techniques needed for personal and team success

The School of Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs has launched the Graduate Inclusivity Fellows program. This year, Graduate Inclusivity Fellows will support recruitment efforts by connecting with prospective and incoming graduate students, and responding to their questions from a graduate student perspective.
Prospective and incoming students can easily submit questions to one of our fellows and connect with them through our [Ask a Grad Student website](https://www.queensu.ca/grad-postdoc/graduate-studies/new-student-orientation/ask-grad-student "https://www.queensu.ca/grad-postdoc/graduate-studies/new-student-orientation/ask-grad-student").
Our fellows have been trained to respond to a wide range of questions about Queen’s for both masters and PhD students, and have also been trained to redirect questions related to program and admission requirements, supervision, and registration to relevant program and SGSPA contacts.
* **Application form** (online). If you cannot complete the online application, please contact [**mpa.admissions@queensu.ca**](https://www.queensu.ca/sps/study-here/mpa.admissions@queensu.ca) for a paper application.
* **Two academic recommendations are required**, typically from professors under whom the applicant has studied
* **If your previous degree is NOT from a Canadian or U.S. university, you will be required to submit a GRE score**. There are no exceptions to this rule. The minimum GRE score requirements are: Verbal Reasoning - 152; Quantitative Reasoning - 149; Analytical Writing - 3.8. We are unable to comment on the competitiveness of scores as this depends on the annual pool of applicants. GRE scores must be received directly from the issuing agency.\*
* **Statement of Interest** (4000 characters)
* **Transcripts:**
1. Official transcripts can be uploaded to the online applications, as PDF files. The transcripts must be scanned (black and white recommended) and saved as a PDF file, and uploaded successfully. 
 _In these unusual circumstances, the School of Graduate Studies will work with whatever arrangements applicants are dealing with. We need the final transcripts for our processes—the documentation is required. But, we can accept the transcript from the issuing university as a pdf or similar document, or any other electronic format, or by fax if that helps. If for some reason the issuing university cannot produce official transcripts, we can accept unofficial transcripts if they are generated and sent by the issuing university and as long as all parties understand an official hard copy transcript will still be required, eventually. We cannot accept any version of any transcripts from applicants directly by email. 
 Transcripts can be emailed to [sgspa.reception@queensu.ca](https://www.queensu.ca/sps/study-here/sgspa.reception@queensu.ca) or our fax number is 1-613-533-6015. Canada Post services on campus is still operational 2 days per week, so we can pick up and process mail, including transcripts, 2 times per week (mailing address - School of Graduate Studies, Queen's University, Gordon Hall Room 425, 74 Union Street, Kingston, Ontario, Canada K7L 3N6). But, our office building is closed to the public currently, so courier deliveries (ie FedEX, UPS, Purolator, etc.) cannot be processed for now._
2. If a transcript or transcripts cannot be successfully uploaded to the online applications, applicants are responsible for ensuring that an official transcript or transcripts of all current and previous university-level studies are sent to the School of Graduate Studies by all universities previously attended. All hard copy transcripts received as part of an application for admission must be received in sealed envelopes.
3. Final transcript: hard copy original official transcript showing degree completion and conferral, will be required from all applicants who accept an offer of admission to graduate studies at Queen's University. These final transcripts are to be sent directly from the issuing institutions to the School of Graduate Studies, in sealed envelopes. Official transcripts are NOT REQUIRED for any study of any kind carried out at Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario. The School of Graduate Studies will access the student record directly for applicants who have attended or are currently attending Queen's University.
\*Transcripts and GRE scores are to be sent from the issuing university and testing center to the following address:
**School of Graduate Studies** 
Gordon Hall, Room 425 
74 Union Street 
Queen's University 
Kingston, ON K7L 3N6 CANADA
Admission decisions are made on a competitive basis among qualified applicants each year. As the number of applications greatly exceeds the number of available places, not all qualified candidates will be offered admission. An applicant should note that no decision on admission can be made until the applicant's file is complete. It is the responsibility of the applicant to verify that Queen's has received all documents. You may check online to see if your file is complete.
The review of MPA applications will take place in March. Successful MPA candidates may expect to receive notice of their admission no later than 15 April. A second review of MPA applications, being held on a waiting list, may take place in the early summer or later, as places become available prior to the start of classes in September.
Formal offers of admission are issued by the **[School of Graduate Studies](https://www.queensu.ca/sgs/current-students/registration-fees)**.
**Application Deadlines**:  February 1, 2025 for September 2025 intake.

## Scholarship Opportunities
There are 10 Academic Excellence Awards available to new Master’s students (entering Year 1 as of Fall term) valued $15,000 for one year. Canadian citizens or permanent residents of Canada who have achieved a first-class average (equivalent to an A- or better at Queen’s), in each of the last two completed years of study (full-time equivalent), are eligible to be considered for the AEA.
Prospective new students who have also applied, or who will apply, to NSERC, SSHRC or CIHR, need not make a separate AEA application—we will use their tri-council application to considered them for the AEA. The online application is for **_prospective new students_** who are eligible to be considered for the AEA, but who did not submit an application for the current tri-council competition.
The online application to the Academic Excellence Award (AEA) has not been announced for 2021-2022 at this time. Details about the award, and a link to the online application when and if available, can be found on the [**School of Graduate Studies website**](https://www.queensu.ca/grad-postdoc/). More details, including the deadlines, are available here.
Some of the most common questions students have when both applying to and once enrolled in graduate school relate to funding their degree. Queen’s offers a range of opportunities for students to receive financial support.
Find out more about funding opportunities for Indigenous students by visiting the [School of Graduate Studies website](https://www.queensu.ca/grad-postdoc/).
The [Ontario Graduate Scholarships](https://osap.gov.on.ca/OSAPPortal/en/A-ZListofAid/PRDR019245.html) (OGS) promote excellence in graduate studies at the master's and doctoral levels. OGS awards are merit-based scholarships available to graduate students in all graduate disciplines in Ontario Universities. Eligible students apply for OGS through each university for which they have applied.
Scholarship Value: $15,000 for one academic year, normally paid out in 3 equal installments. The award is not renewable.

# [Appeal Process | Office of the University Ombudsperson](https://www.queensu.ca/ombuds/appeal-process/appeal-process) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/ombuds/appeal-process/appeal-process_

Academic Regulations at Queen’s University were designed to ensure that students are being treated fairly and equitably while upholding the academic standards of the institution. 
On occasion, there are circumstances that are usually beyond a student’s control that may have impacted their performance at Queen’s. Appeal processes were developed to reconsider the appropriateness of any sanctions or penalties that may have been imposed upon a student. Typically for any appeal process, there are limited grounds for filing an appeal, which could include extenuating circumstances or significant procedural irregularity. 
Review the rules and regulations of your Faculty or School to ensure your circumstances meet the ground(s) for appeal.

# [Self-Guided Support - Siteimprove](https://www.queensu.ca/its/accessibility) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/its/accessibility_

## Introduction
Queen’s is committed to building an inclusive community with accessible spaces and services, and has implemented an [Accessibility Framework](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/across-campus/queens-accessibility-initiatives/accessibility-framework) to address accessibility compliance on campus. Making our websites accessible is a key part of ensuring everyone has access to university services and information.
The [Accessibility Hub](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/) and [IT Services](https://www.queensu.ca/its/) have partnered to provide a [**Web-Accessibility Compliance Auditing service**](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/tutorials/website-accessibility/web-accessibility-compliance-auditing-queens-websites "Web-Accessibility Compliance Auditing service") to help you identify ways to improve the accessibility of your website and ensure that it is compliant with the [provincial accessibility requirements](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/across-campus/aoda/integrated-accessibility-standards-regulation-iasr/information-and) outlined in Section 14 of the Accessibility for Ontarians with a Disability Act (AODA).
In an effort to support website owners in ensuring that they are meeting the needs of all users, IT Services negotiated a subscription for [Siteimprove web governance software](https://siteimprove.com/en-ca/). Siteimprove provides flexible reporting for accessibility compliance at Levels A, AA and AAA of WCAG 2.0. It can also be used for general quality assurance, by identifying broken links and misspellings.
Individuals who manage a publicly accessible website at Queen’s will be given unlimited access to the software to perform their own audits and review reports and recommendations. The service is offered free of charge, for the duration of the current subscription.
## Eligibility
Siteimprove user accounts are available to any individual managing one or more publicly-accessible websites associated with Queen’s University.
## Getting Started
To request changes to existing users or sites, including the addition of new sites or additional users accounts, as well as [CMS Deeplinks](https://queensu.service-now.com/esm?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0012790 "CMS Deeplinks"), please use the [Siteimprove Request Form](https://queensu.service-now.com/esm?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=ce07c1451b3704d0f437a9fbbc4bcb8c).
Siteimprove provides help and support within the application itself. There are video tutorials and user FAQs to help users get started with the software and find quick solutions for common accessibility issues, as well as webinars offered on a regular basis.

## 1: INTRODUCTION
##### **1.1 Purpose**
The purpose of the Academic Calendar is to acquaint students with the academic requirements, regulations, policies, procedures and expectations of the Program. It is the responsibility of the student to read and understand the entire Academic Calendar. Questions about any of its contents should be directed to the Program Director.
* * *
##### 1.2 Acknowledgement of Territory 
Queen’s University in Kingston is situated on traditional Anishinaabe and Haudenosaunee Territory. To acknowledge this traditional territory is to recognize its longer history, one predating the establishment of the earliest European colonies. It is also to acknowledge this territory’s significance for the Indigenous peoples who lived, and continue to live, upon it – people whose practices and spiritualities were tied to the land and continue to develop in relationship to the territory and its other inhabitants today. The Kingston Indigenous community continues to reflect the area’s Anishinaabek and Haudenosaunee roots. There is also a significant Métis community and there are First Peoples from other Nations across Turtle Island1 present today.
_1 Turtle Island is the name of North America according to some Indigenous groups._
## 2: PROGRAM CURRICULUM AND GRADING
##### 2.1 Jurisdiction 
Students of Smith School of Business at Queen’s University are governed by the regulations, policies and practices of this institution. 
Master of Finance (Beijing) students are enrolled at Queen’s University and are therefore subject to the policies, regulations, and requirements of Queen’s.  Students are also subject to the policies, regulations and requirements of Renmin University.
It is the responsibility of every student in the Program to read and understand these policies, regulations, and requirements as well as those of Renmin University. 
* * *
##### 2.2 Program Format 
The Queen’s Master of Finance (Beijing) Program is approved by the Senate and Board of Trustees of the University, and by the Ontario Council for Graduate Studies. Upon graduation, students receive a Queen’s Master of Finance Degree. 
The Queen’s Master of Finance (Beijing) Program provides students with the opportunity to gain the educational and professional advantages of a Queen’s Program without interrupting a successful career.  The curriculum was designed with the understanding that students already have an undergraduate degree in business and management experience. Therefore, while management fundamentals in all functional areas will be reviewed and incorporated into our courses, the Program will focus on developing the skills and advanced knowledge required to lead today’s organizations.
**2.2.1 Program Delivery** 
Queen’s Master of Finance (Beijing) Program holds most classes on weekday night and weekends on campus of Renmin University of China in Beijing. Students have the option to travel to Canada for one of the Queen's-led courses. 
The courses require individual and team preparation and are delivered primarily through fully interactive classroom teaching. 
During the orientation, students are introduced to the instructors, and program staff from both universities.
* * *
##### 2.3 Timeframe 
Once registered in the Program, the student is expected to complete all degree requirements without interruption. The Program is normally completed in 10 to 11 months, beginning in September and ending in September of the following year.
* * *
##### 2.4 Degree Requirements and Courses
The Queen’s Master of Finance (Beijing) Program is a 10-11 month program in which students complete 10 courses. To be eligible for graduation, students must complete all courses in the Program in the year in which they are registered, and uphold and/or meet each of the Academic Regulations (Section 3 of this document). 
**2.4.1 Required Courses** 
All required courses for the Program must be completed in the year that the student is registered in the Program.
Students must adhere to the Program’s add/drop policy and deadlines for any changes to course registrations. The Program Sessional Dates include applicable add/drop dates.
**2.4.2 Course Substitutions** 
Students must complete all required courses within the required timeframe to graduate from the Program. 
If extenuating circumstances prevent a student from completing the Program in the required timeframe, the student will be required to complete outstanding courses as directed by the Program Director or Academic Progress Committee. Normally, if one or more of the missed courses is not offered again in the year the student is registered in the Program, the student will be permitted to take the course in the subsequent year when the course is offered again.
**2.4.3 Auditing Courses** 
A student may request to audit a course. A formal written request to audit must be made to the Program Director at least seven days before the first session of the course to be audited. Requests to audit courses will be considered depending on space, professor approval and other relevant course-specific factors.

\*Aegrotat: An academic entry that provides an estimated final grade or, if that is not possible, credit for a course without a grade because of extenuating circumstances beyond the student’s control that prevented the student from completing all work of the course, particularly the final examination. Normally at least 60 percent of the work to be evaluated in the course (assignments, midterms, final examination, as specified in the course) must have been completed. Requests for AG or CR standing should be made to the Program Director.
**2.5.2 Grading Specifications** 
All final marks, including those assigned after special examinations, may be based on the results of formal examinations and on grades obtained from other work throughout the course, which may include essays, exercises, reports, presentations, class tests/quizzes, and class participation or other work. 
At the beginning of each course, the professor will provide a clear statement of the basis on which the final mark will be assessed. All work assigned and the weight that it will contribute to the final mark will be specified. Normally there is both individual and team work included in course assessments.
**2.5.3 Class Participation** 
Class participation grades are allocated in some courses. Professors will specify the specific form and opportunities for participation marks at the start of the course. Some examples include contributions to class discussions or discussion boards, attendance, timely completion of assigned work, or other relevant behaviours determined by the professor.
## 3: ACADEMIC REGULATIONS AND STANDING
Academic Regulations exist to maintain the standards of the Program, and to ensure the candidates of the Program have the mandatory knowledge and experience to merit receiving the Degree. Degrees are awarded according to the requirements and processes set out in the Academic Regulations.
Every student is responsible for knowing and meeting or upholding the Academic Regulations of the Program in order to progress through the Program and ultimately be eligible for the Degree. The Academic Regulations below are currently in effect. Regulations are consistently reviewed and may change from time to time.

* * *
##### 3.2 Academic Standing 
The following Academic Standings may apply, depending on individual circumstances:
**3.2.1 Good Academic Standing** 
In order to progress through the Program and to be eligible for the Degree, a student must be in Good Academic Standing. A student is considered to be in Good Academic Standing when they uphold the Academic Regulations set out in Section 3.1 above.
A student who fails to uphold any one of the Academic Regulations is no longer in Good Academic Standing, and is normally required to withdraw from the Program. The student is considered to be in Academic Jeopardy until a decision is made by the appropriate body. 
**3.2.2 Academic Jeopardy** 
A student who fails to meet any one or more of the Academic Regulations is deemed to be in Academic Jeopardy until a decision is made about their situation.
Students in this situation will first be reviewed by the Program Director. In some cases an informal resolution may be possible (for example, an opportunity to re-take an exam if the student has official evidence of being gravely ill on the day of the exam) and, if successful, the student may return to Good Academic Standing.
In cases where an informal resolution is not possible, the Program Director will inform the student in writing of the requirement to withdraw from the Program, subject to the student’s right of appeal.
**3.2.3 Academic Probation** 
A student who has failed to meet one or more of the Academic Regulations and who has successfully appealed to the Academic Progress Committee may be permitted to continue in the Program, on Academic Probation, subject to specific terms, conditions, standards and timeframes tailored to the situation. 
A student who successfully completes the conditions of their Academic Probation will be released from Academic Probation and return to Good Academic Standing. A student who fails to meet the conditions of their Academic Probation will normally be required to withdraw from the Program, subject to their right of appeal. 
**3.2.4 Requirement to Withdraw**  
A student who has failed to meet any one or more of the Academic Regulations is normally required to withdraw from the Program, subject to their right of appeal (see section 5). Further, a student who fails to meet the conditions of their Academic Probation will normally be required to withdraw from the Program.
**3.2.5 Effective Date of Sanctions** 
Sanctions or adverse academic decisions, such as Academic Probation (and its terms and conditions) or a requirement to withdraw, shall take effect as soon as the student accepts the sanction OR exhausts (or allows to lapse) their right to appeal to the next level in accordance with Section 35 of [Queen’s University Senate Policy on Student Appeals, Rights and Discipline](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/senate/student-academic-appeals-policy):
1. _Ordinarily, no sanction, penalty or requirement to withdraw shall be put into effect until the student affected has either exhausted all channels of appeal or has allowed the time for appeal to lapse. For the purpose of this provision, the University will normally consider an adverse academic decision to be a sanction._
2. _Notwithstanding subsection (1), where an academic unit determines that the interests of third parties may be prejudiced by the continued enrollment of a student in a course or program, the unit may decide that pending an appeal from an adverse academic decision, the student should not be permitted to continue in the course or program, or may be precluded from progressing to the next academic stage._
3. _A student who is subject to suspension from a program under subsection (2) may request that the Chair of the appellate body with jurisdiction over the matter expedite the hearing of the appeal. This request may result in a direction abridging the time for filing of documents, or other interim or preliminary direction made pursuant to Section 36 of Queen’s University Senate Policy on Student Appeals, Rights and Discipline._
## 4: ACADEMIC STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS
##### 4.1 Academic Integrity 
Queen’s University is dedicated to creating a scholarly community free to explore a range of ideas, to build and advance knowledge, and to share the ideas and knowledge that emerge from a range of intellectual pursuits.
Queen’s students, faculty, administrators and staff therefore all have responsibilities for supporting and upholding the fundamental values of academic integrity. Academic integrity is a commitment to the fundamental values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. Academic integrity concerns refer to issues that arise which deserve attention, and which may or may not, in the end, involve a departure from academic integrity, that is, a departure from these fundamental values. This involves what has traditionally been referred to as academic dishonesty but encompasses a much broader context to include educational measures associated with academic integrity. Academic integrity is constituted by the five core fundamental values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility (see [International Centre for Academic Integrity](https://academicintegrity.org/)) and by the quality of courage. These values and qualities are central to the building, nurturing, and sustaining of an academic community in which all members of the community will thrive. 
Adherence to the values expressed through academic integrity forms a foundation for the "freedom of inquiry and exchange of ideas" essential to the intellectual life of the University.
The following statements from “The Fundamental Values of Academic Integrity” (2nd edition), developed by the International Center for Academic Integrity (ICAI), contextualize these values and qualities:
1. **Honesty:** Academic communities of integrity advance the quest for truth and knowledge through intellectual and personal honesty in learning, teaching, research, and service.
2. **Trust:** Academic communities of integrity both foster and rely upon climates of mutual trust. Climates of trust encourage and support the free exchange of ideas which in turn allows scholarly inquiry to reach its fullest potential.
3. **Fairness:** Academic communities of integrity establish clear and transparent expectations, standards, and practices to support fairness in the interactions of students, faculty, and administrators.
4. **Respect:** Academic communities of integrity value the interactive, cooperative, participatory nature of learning. They honor, value, and consider diverse opinions and ideas.
5. **Responsibility:** Academic communities of integrity rest upon foundations of personal accountability coupled with the willingness of individuals and groups to lead by example, uphold mutually agreed-upon standards, and take action when they encounter wrongdoing.
6. **Courage:** To develop and sustain communities of integrity, it takes more than simply believing in the fundamental values. Translating the values from talking points into action -- standing up for them in the face of pressure and adversity — requires determination, commitment, and courage.
Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with and adhering to the regulations concerning academic integrity. More information can be found in the Queens University Senate [Academic Integrity Procedures – Requirements of Faculties & Schools](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/senate/academic-integrity-procedures-requirements-faculties-schools). General information on academic integrity is available at [Queen's University Academic Integrity](https://www.queensu.ca/academicintegrity/) along with School-specific information in the [Smith School of Business Academic Integrity Policy](https://smith.queensu.ca/_templates/documents/general/Policy%20-%20School%20of%20Business%20Academic%20Integrity%20-%20updated%20Aug%202015.pdf).
**4.1.1 Departures from Academic Integrity**
A departure from academic integrity includes any deliberate attempt to gain unfair advantage academically for oneself or others. All forms of departure from academic integrity are considered serious offences within the University community. The following defines the domain of relevant acts without providing an exhaustive list:
**4.1.1.1 Plagiarism** 
Allowing it to be thought that another's ideas or phrasings are one's own by failing to provide proper acknowledgment. Some examples are:
* Copying and pasting from the internet
* Copying a printed source or other resource without proper acknowledgment
* Copying from another student in the same or different year of the Program or another Program
* Copying from another’s test paper.
* Using direct quotations or large sections of paraphrased material in an assignment without appropriate acknowledgment
* Buying term papers or other assignments and submitting them as one's own
* Submitting the same piece of work in more than one course without the permission of the instructors
* Obtaining a copy of, or information about, a test or exam from an earlier section of the course and writing the test or exam later in the day or subsequent days.
**4.1.1.2 Use of unauthorized materials:**
* Possessing or using unauthorized study materials or aids during a test
* Copying from another's test paper.
* Using an unauthorized calculator or other aids during a test
* Unauthorized removal of materials from the library, or deliberate concealment of library materials
* Obtaining materials such as answer keys and using them to obtain an unfair advantage.
**4.1.1.3 Facilitation:**
* Enabling another's breach of academic integrity.
* Making information available to another student, such as knowingly allowing one's essay or assignment to be copied by someone else, giving a copy of a test or exam to a student writing the same test or exam later in the day or subsequent days.
* Selling or distributing term papers or other assignments
* Knowingly assisting another person to conceal their departure from academic integrity.
**4.1.1.4 Unauthorized collaboration:**
* Working with others, without the specific permission of the instructor, on assignments that will be submitted for a grade.
* This applies to in-class or take-home tests, papers, or homework assignments. Students may not collaborate without the instructor’s authorization.
**4.1.1.5 Forgery:**
* Utilizing counterfeit documents or statements (e.g., creating or altering a transcript, medical note or other official documents).
**4.1.1.6 Falsification:**
* Misrepresentation of oneself, one's work or one's relation to the University.
* Altering transcripts or other official documents relating to student records
* Impersonating someone in an examination or test
* Submitting a take-home examination written, in whole or in part, by someone else
* Fabricating or falsifying research data or source material (whether by commission or by omission)
* Allowing someone else to do research work without the knowledge and approval of the instructor.
* Failing to appropriately recognize the contributions of others.
* Attributing authorship of work to persons other than those who have contributed to the work in a meaningful way.
**4.1.2 Process for Investigating Suspected Departures from Academic Integrity** 
The [Smith School of Business Academic Integrity Policy](https://smith.queensu.ca/_templates/documents/general/Policy%20-%20School%20of%20Business%20Academic%20Integrity%20-%20updated%20Aug%202015.pdf) sets out complete procedures and processes for handling suspected departures from academic integrity. Students are responsible for familiarizing themselves with the policy. Normally, where a course professor has a concern about a possible departure from academic integrity, the professor will notify the student and investigate in accordance with Smith policy. The student will have an opportunity to respond, and their response will be considered part of the evidence in the case.
In complex cases, the professor may refer the case to the Smith School of Business Academic Integrity Panel for investigation. In this situation, the Academic Integrity Panel will notify the student of the potential departure and investigate in accordance with Smith policy.
In cases of a subsequent departure from academic integrity (that is, where there is a previous departure on record for the student), the professor will make a finding but refer the case to the Academic Integrity Panel for the determination of a sanction.
**4.1.3 Sanctions for Departures from Academic Integrity** 
Following the investigation of the suspected departure from Academic Integrity, the professor/Academic Integrity Panel will either: i) make a finding of a departure from academic integrity and impose a sanction (or refer the matter to the AI Panel for sanction); or ii) determine there was no departure and destroy all evidence of the notice and investigation.
Any student who is found to have committed a violation of academic integrity may face a range of sanctions, including but not limited to: receiving a warning, a grade of zero on the assignment, a failure in the course, a recommendation to Queen's Senate that the student be required to withdraw from the University for a period of time, or that a degree be rescinded. 
Records of findings of departures from AI are kept in the Dean’s Office and in the Program Office. Students who are found to have subsequent violations of academic integrity will normally face progressively more serious sanctions.
* * *
##### 4.2 Illness and Extenuating Circumstances Policies 
**4.2.1 Illness**
A student who claims illness as a reason for missing academic obligations is responsible for informing the professor and the Program Director and may be required to provide evidence of illness. In keeping with University [Policy on Academic Consideration for Students in Extenuating Circumstances](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/senate/academic-consideration-students-extenuating-circumstances-procedure), a student suffering from a short-term illness should submit the [appropriate form](http://www.queensu.ca/studentwellness/home/forms/extenuating-circumstances) outlining their needs.
A notification of absence from an examination must be accompanied by documentation as follows:
* in cases of illness when a student is under the care of a physician, the student should provide a note from the physician. Retroactive doctors’ notes (i.e. notes dated from physicians after the illness) are not acceptable.
* If a student is ill, but not under the care of a physician prior to and during an exam, they can provide the [appropriate form(s)](http://www.queensu.ca/studentwellness/home/forms/extenuating-circumstances) outlining their situation.
As a matter of academic integrity, a student is responsible for making an honest declaration concerning the nature of their illness and its impact on their academic obligations. False declarations may be investigated under the Smith Academic Integrity Policy.
**4.2.2 Extenuating Circumstances**
The Program adheres to Queen’s [Policy on Academic Consideration for Students in Extenuating Circumstances](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/senate/academic-consideration-students-extenuating-circumstances-procedure) and the principle of a good faith response to requests for consideration.
Extenuating circumstances means a personal circumstance beyond the student’s control that has a direct and substantial impact on the student’s ability to meet essential academic requirements or expectations. Extenuating circumstances include but are not limited to a sudden or acute physical or mental illness, serious injury to self or significant others, bereavement, a traumatic event, or other serious personal/family crisis. Extenuating circumstances may also include officially representing the university at a sanctioned event or through an invitation to participate in an event as a distinguished guest (e.g. national tournament, Olympics).
 A student who is unable to satisfy the requirements of a course or the Program due to extenuating circumstances must notify the Program Director in writing as soon as possible. Students may submit the [appropriate form(s](http://www.queensu.ca/studentwellness/home/forms/extenuating-circumstances)).
If the student is requesting a modification of the Program requirements, a formal written request should be submitted to the Program Director. The request for modification should include an explanation of the connection between the effects of extenuating circumstances on the academic performance, as well as the remedy the student is seeking.
The Program Director will respond to the student’s request for consideration promptly. The Program is committed to responding to students in a fair and consistent manner, taking into account the specific individual circumstances. The Program is also committed to upholding academic standards and ensuring that essential academic requirements are met.
**4.2.3 Official Documentation**
Official documentation, including notes from health care professionals, need not outline the specific details of the student’s condition, but must clearly indicate ways in which the circumstances directly affect the student’s performance, and verify that these effects were substantial enough to cause the academic disruption. Information about the start, duration and present state of the condition or circumstances, as well as a clear statement on whether the condition or circumstances have either improved or are being managed so that they will not have a significant detrimental effect on future academic performance, are essential.
Documents submitted may be verified by the Program administration. False statements or documents may be investigated in accordance with the Smith Policy on Academic Integrity
**4.2.4 Unresolved Circumstances**
The appeals process does not compensate for circumstances that the student is unable to resolve, or for which the student is unwilling to actively seek accommodation. In addition, the appeals process does not compensate for circumstances that are actively being accommodated, for example where a student’s permanent disabilities are being accommodated through Queen’s Student Accessibility Services Office.
Multiple appeals citing the same circumstances will be reviewed very closely. This review may include, with the permission of the student, consultation with the appropriate professionals involved to obtain more detailed information. In order for such an appeal to succeed, there must be convincing evidence that the circumstances that affected the student’s academic performance will be resolved within a reasonable timeline, or will be appropriately managed on an ongoing basis.
* * *
##### 4.3 Language 
In accordance with [Queen’s University Language Policy](http://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/senate/language-policy), examinations and assignments are to be submitted in English, except where a Faculty Board has approved an alternative practice or where a special agreement has been entered into between the Program and a student.
* * *
##### 4.4 Acceptable Use of Information Technology Resources Policy
All members of the Queen’s community are bound by the [Queen’s policy on the Acceptable Use of Information Technology (IT) Resources](http://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/senate/electronic-information-security-policy-framework/acceptable-use-information). The policy states:
_The use of Queen's University information technology (IT) resources must be consistent with the academic mission of the University. These IT resources are provided to support the teaching, learning, research and administrative activities of the Queen's community. As a member or guest of the Queen's community, you may have access to valuable internal and external networks and resources, and Sensitive Information, and you are expected to use these resources in a responsible, ethical, and legal manner. Your actions should not adversely affect the ability of others to use these resources, or compromise the security and privacy of sensitive information._
**4.4.1 Submission of Electronic Documents**
Students may be required to submit assignments electronically. It is the responsibility of the student to ensure that all electronic submissions are corruption-free.
Any assignment that is detected to be carrying a corrupt file will be immediately destroyed, and the student must re-submit the assignment corruption-free. If the assignment is not re-submitted before the assignment deadline it will be marked “late.” 
* * *
##### 4.5 Examinations
**4.5.1 Access to Examinations**
The term final examination paper refers to the final examination question paper in a course together with the graded answer paper written by the student. These documents, in accordance with the [Senate Policy on Student Access to Final Examination Papers](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/senate/senate-policy-student-access-final-examination-papers), must be retained by the professor or the School for a period of 12 months.
_**4.5.1.1 Informal Access**_
Professors may informally review the final examination paper with a student who requests it and are encouraged to do so. However, access may not be granted before the final marks are released.
_**4.5.1.2 Formal Access**_
A student may obtain access to their final exam as part of an appeal process. This may be supervised access to, or a copy of, the final examination paper. The student should contact the Program administration to arrange for formal access to their final exam.
_**4.5.1.3 Changes to Examination Times**_
Requests for changes to an individual examination time must be made to the Program Director as soon as the student is aware of a conflict. Normally, such requests will only be granted if extenuating circumstances (beyond the student’s control) will prevent the student from writing the exam at the scheduled time.
The exam dates for the courses with exams will be posted well in advance of the date of the exam. The policies regarding exam locations and change of dates are set out below.
1. At least one month in advance of the first exam date, students will receive a survey from the Program administration through an online survey setting out the upcoming exam locations. Each student must choose their site preference no later than two weeks in advance of the first scheduled exam date, and this will become the default location for all subsequent exams.
2. Changes to the preferred exam location can be made up to two weeks prior to any subsequent exam by sending a request in writing to both the Program Manager and the Administrative Coordinator, Assignments and Exams at Queen’s. Students should understand that changes requested within two weeks of the exam may not be permitted.
3. All requests for changes to exam dates must meet the following criteria:
 1. A written request for the change of date must be received by the Program Manager at Queen’s at least two weeks in advance of the exam; the request must clearly state the reason for the change.
 2. All requests must be approved by the Program administration in consultation with the course professor; this process may require supporting documentation.
 3. The student requesting the change of exam date must secure their own proctor and secure their own exam location and pay all associated costs. The student will be provided with a list of persons who qualify to be proctors for exams conducted by Queen’s.
 4. In extenuating circumstances, changes to exam dates may be considered if the criteria set out in 1 and 2 above are not met.
* * *
##### 4.6 Queen's University Student Code of Conduct 
Queen’s University is dedicated to learning, intellectual inquiry, the dissemination and advancement of knowledge, personal and professional development, and good citizenship. All students are required to read and adhere to [Queen’s University Student Code of Conduct](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/sites/uslcwww/files/uploaded_files/policies/board/StudentCodeOfConduct.pdf).
Students are expected to adhere to and promote the University’s core values of honesty, trust, fairness, respect and personal responsibility in all aspects of University life, academic and non-academic. These core values are intended to inform and guide student conduct as they foster mutual respect for the dignity, property, rights and well-being of others.
As a member of the Queen’s community, every student accepts the University’s policies, rules and procedures and acknowledges the right of the University to set standards of conduct, as well as the right of the University and/or its Authorized Agent(s) to impose sanctions for conduct found to have violated those standards. 
**4.6.1 Professionalism and Facilities Etiquette**
All study and work spaces provided by Smith School of Business should be treated with respect and care. All students are expected to properly reserve space, use the facilities for the purposes for which they are intended, and to leave spaces clean, tidy, in the proper furniture configuration and with the room supplies.
## 5: ACADEMIC DECISIONS AND APPEALS
 
Various types of academic decisions may be made by a course professor, Program Director, Academic Progress Committee, Academic Integrity Panel, Academic Appeals Committee and/or the University Student Appeal Board. 
The appeals process at Queen’s University is comprised of several levels of appeal by different appeal bodies. In accordance with the [Senate Policy on Student Appeals, Rights and Discipline](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/senate/student-academic-appeals-policy), the decision system is based on the principle that "decisions should generally be made by those who are most familiar with the context”2. 
Appeals of academic decisions fall into four possible categories: appeals of grades (Section 5.1), appeals of other academic decisions (Section 5.2), appeals of academic standing and progression decisions (Section 5.3), and appeals of academic integrity decisions (Section 5.4).
Note that it is the student’s responsibility to clearly establish that grounds for an appeal exist as the basis for an appeal. Below the various decision-making bodies and their mandates are explained.
_2  Senate Policy on Student Appeals, Rights, and Discipline, Introduction (Section A.2)._
##### 5.1 Appeals of Grades
Grades are determined by course professors. Appeals of grades in courses (including assignments, examination papers, and final grades) are first handled at the course professor level.  
Examination papers and course marks of students whose final grade in a course is marginally below a letter grade, and especially below a failing grade, are reviewed with special care by faculty members before such grades are assigned. Therefore it is unlikely that such a grade is incorrect or unfair to the student. However, if a student feels that a course grade or a portion of it has been unfairly assessed, they should first make an attempt to resolve the issue informally with the professor.
If the student feels that the issue remains unresolved, they should contact the Program Director who will initiate a formal grade review. A review of the assignment or examination shall be conducted by two examiners appointed by the Program Director or designate; one examiner shall be the original professor or grader, if available. The review shall involve a re‐reading of the final examination or deliverable(s) in the course and a review of the student’s course record. 
Requests for reconsideration of a course grade must be accompanied by payment of a fee of $100. This fee will be refunded to the student if, as a result of the review, a failing grade is raised to a pass or if a pass is raised by as much as five marks or to a higher letter grade. Note that it is the responsibility of the student to preserve all exercises, papers, reports, and other graded material for the course and to submit a copy of these documents with the request for review. The scanned copy of any graded assignment or material returned to a student shall be deemed to be the original document for the purposes of this section. 
The decision of the examiner(s) is final, and there is no further appeal available.
* * *
##### 5.2 Appeals of Other Academic Decisions 
The Program Director makes some decisions for students facing special circumstances in the Program. The student should request consideration as appropriate to the Program Director as soon as they are aware of a situation requiring such consideration. Examples of such decisions could include: changing a course registration from one elective to another, or deferring an exam. 
Appeals of decisions by the Program Director are made to the Academic Progress Committee. 
* * *
##### 5.3 Appeals of Academic Standing and Progression Decisions 
Students are considered to be in Good Academic Standing unless they have violated one or more of the Academic Regulations of the Program. As noted, students who violate one or more of the Academic Regulations of the Program are normally required to withdraw from the Program. In such a case, the Program Director will normally inform the student in writing that, because of their violation of one or more of the Regulations, they are required to withdraw from the Program. 
Appeals of these decisions are made to the Academic Progress Committee.
* * *
##### 5.4 Appeals of Academic Integrity Decisions 
Course professors will normally investigate and make decisions regarding possible violations of academic integrity in their courses in accordance with the [Smith School of Business Academic Integrity Policy](https://smith.queensu.ca/_templates/documents/general/Policy%20-%20School%20of%20Business%20Academic%20Integrity%20-%20updated%20Aug%202015.pdf) and as set out in Section 4.1. 
Appeals of professors’ decisions regarding academic integrity are made to the Academic Integrity Panel. 
In cases where the Academic Integrity Panel is the initial decision-maker, appeals are made to the Academic Appeals Committee.

Appeals of academic decisions for courses led by Renmin Faculty are subject to the policies and procedures at Renmin University. Students should note that Queen’s has no jurisdiction, or ability to influence Renmin in these matters.
## 6: STUDENT SERVICES
##### 6.1 Educational Equity 
Through the [Educational Equity Policy](http://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/senate/educational-equity-policy), Queen's University recognizes that the values of equity and diversity are vital to and in harmony with its educational mission and standards of excellence. It acknowledges that direct, indirect and systemic discrimination exist within our institutional structures, policies and practices and in our community. These take many forms and work to differentially advantage and disadvantage persons across social identities such as race, ethnicity, disability, gender identity, sexual orientation, faith and socioeconomic status, among other examples.
Queen's is committed to counteracting discrimination in this institution and developing a climate of educational equity that recognizes and respects the equal dignity and worth of all who seek to participate in the life, work and mission of the University. Such a climate is created and maintained by developing a university-wide commitment to and understanding of educational equity, supported by policies, programs, curricula, practices and traditions that facilitate individuals - and equity-seeking groups- free, safe, and full participation.
Any student who has concerns related to educational equity may contact the Program Director, the [University Ombudsperson,](https://www.queensu.ca/ombuds/home) and/or the [Human Rights and Equity Office](https://www.queensu.ca/hreo/).
* * *
##### 6.2 Accommodation for Special Needs/Disabilities
[Queen’s Policy Concerning Students with Disabilities](http://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/senate/queens-policy-concerning-students-disabilities) states:
_Queen's University is committed to facilitating the integration of students with disabilities into the University community. While all students must satisfy the essential requirements for courses and programs, the administration, faculty, staff, and students at Queen's are expected to provide reasonable accommodation to students with disabilities. Reasonable accommodation may require members of the University community to exercise creativity and flexibility in responding to the needs of students with disabilities while maintaining academic standards._
_This policy acknowledges that fundamental to the academic and personal success of students is their responsibility both to demonstrate self-reliance and to identify needs requiring accommodation._
It is the responsibility of students in need of accommodation for a disability or other special need to contact [Queen’s Student Accessibility Services](http://www.queensu.ca/studentwellness/accessibility-services) to register for formal accommodations. In partnership with Student Accessibility Services, the Program will work to ensure that appropriate modifications or accommodations are made in accordance with [Queen’s Policy on Academic Accommodations for Students with Disabilities](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/senate/academic-accommodations-students-disabilities-policy) and Queen’s [Academic Accommodations for Students with Disabilities Procedure](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/academic-accommodations-students-disabilities-procedure).

Among other duties, the Office of the University Ombudsman: receives, assesses, and facilitates the informal resolution of concerns and complaints; provides confidential and independent advice and support to members of the University community; acts as a liaison between individuals and/or groups at all levels serving as a communicator or informal conciliator; and mediates the resolution of complaints.
Any student who finds themselves in an appeal situation is strongly advised to contact the University Ombudsman for advice, assistance and support.
## 7: ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES
##### 7.1 The Faculty Board of Smith School of Business
In May 1963, the Faculty Board of Smith School of Business was established by the Board of Trustees of the University on the Senate's recommendation, to provide an appropriate body for the regulation of the conduct of the School's academic programs.
The Faculty Board of Smith School of Business (SSB) is constituted as follows: the Principal (ex officio), the Dean and Associate Dean(s) of Smith School of Business, all regular faculty of SSB, all adjunct academic staff of SSB, all other persons, who are currently teaching or whose appointment is in force at the date of the meeting or those in other faculties giving required courses for any of the degree programs in SSB; one senior administrative officer from each of the major teaching programs (eg., BCom, Queen's MBA, Exec MBA, AMBA, Exec MBA Americas, Master of Management, MSc/PhD); a representative of all non-academic, non-teaching staff of Smith School of Business (to be elected by this group); President of the Commerce Society, two BCom student Senators, two other representatives from the Commerce Society, one student representative from the Queen's MBA program, one student representative from the Executive MBA Programs, one representative from the AMBA Program, one representative from the Exec MBA Americas Program, one student representative from the Master of Management Programs, one representative from the MSc Program, one from the PhD Program.
**7.1.1 Review of Record by Faculty Board** 
The Faculty Board of the School of Business reserves the right to review the record of any student. The Faculty Board will recommend to the Senate the granting of the Degree, after all courses have been completed in accordance with the provisions specified in this Calendar.
* * *
##### 7.2 Student Names
As the University is committed to the integrity of its student records, each student is required to provide either on application for admission or on personal data forms required for registration, their complete, legal name. Any requests to change a name, by means of alteration, deletion, substitution or addition must be accompanied by appropriate supporting documentation in accordance with the [University Policy on Student Names](https://www.queensu.ca/registrar/resources/policies/student-names).
* * *
##### 7.3 Confidentiality
The Program acknowledges that confidentiality is a serious and important issue for students. Students may be submitting and developing confidential business plans and strategies, and these submissions are carefully protected. All staff sign confidentiality agreements. These confidentiality agreements are kept on file in the Program office, and students may request a copy at any time.
Class discussions will frequently include company-specific examples. In order to encourage open class discussions, all in-class discussions should be held in the strictest confidence by students and professors, and must not be discussed outside of class. Recorded classes are for the purpose of helping students in their studies and must not be copied, shared or distributed in any way. 
**7.3.1 Sharing of Student Data** 
During the course of the program, the Program may share the names of persons enrolled in the GDA program with the institutes of the professional accounting bodies in order to facilitate the record keeping on the part of those professional bodies. This is intended to prevent those students taking the GDA program from having their qualifications judged on a course by course basis, which would not be appropriate given the accreditation status of the Smith GDA program. Should a candidate choose not to have this information shared with the professional accounting bodies, the Program Manager must be informed in writing (email is acceptable) within two weeks of the beginning of the Program. Likewise, students enrolled in the GDA Program grant the institutes of the professional accounting bodies permission to share their results on the professional exams with Smith School of Business.
* * *
##### 7.4 Conflict of Interest
Fairness or objectivity may be compromised if academic evaluation is conducted, even in part, by someone to whom there is a close personal or professional tie (for example, a family member or consulting relationship). Where such a tie does exist between student and instructor, the parties involved have the responsibility to declare a potential conflict of interest, normally to the Program Director who will assist, without prejudice, in arranging evaluation by alternative means.
Conflicts of interest may also arise with the sharing of confidential company information on projects, as well as within teams. When this occurs, the parties involved must declare the potential conflict to the Program Director who will make, without prejudice, alternative arrangements
* * *
##### 7.5 Withdrawal and Re-Admission
A student who withdraws from the Program, whether voluntarily or as a result of a requirement to withdraw, is subsequently no longer considered to be an enrolled student of Queen's University. There is no opportunity for students to take a leave of absence from the Program, except in extraordinary circumstances.
**7.5.1 Program Fees and Withdrawals**
The funding model for Smith School of Business Professional Graduate Programs is distinct from MSc and PhD programs at Smith, the latter designated part of the School of Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs. Therefore, the Completion/Withdrawal Schedule for School of Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs does not apply to students registered in Smith School of Business Professional Graduate Programs. If you choose to withdraw from a Professional Graduate Program, you may be eligible for a refund.
Depending on the date of withdrawal and the fees already paid, a participant who withdraws from the Program may be eligible for a refund of fees as follows:
1. Program fees are due in full for all completed courses
2. For partially completed courses, 50% of the course fee is due up to and including half-way point of the course.  After the half-way point of the course, the fee will be prorated based on the length of time the participant is enrolled in the course.
3. The fee for the projects will be prorated based on the credits earned in non-project courses by the participant at the time of withdrawal.
4. There will be no refund of in-residence fees incurred.
5. There will be no refund of advisor fees incurred for individual projects.
6. For refund calculation purposes the fee per course credit is calculated by the Finance Office.  The refund per course is adjusted according to the credit weight of the particular course taken.
Students with a Queen’s or Smith scholarship will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Please contact [**Queen's Smith School of Business**](mailto:businessoffice@queensu.ca) directly for more information.
**7.5.2 Re-admission**
Former students may apply for re-admission. It is important to note that prior admission to the Program is not a guarantee of future re-admission. To initiate an application for re-admission, former students must submit all documents and materials required by the admissions procedures in place at the time of their application for re-admission.
In some cases, a student who has withdrawn will be re-admitted on Academic Probation. Students who withdraw while on Academic Probation will continue on Probation if they are re-admitted to the Program.  Students who have been required to withdraw from the Program will not normally be re-admitted to the Program.
* * *
##### 7.6 Financial Policy
Students should consult the Program website or Director for the fee schedule and late payment policies. 
**7.6.1 Outstanding Debts**
Queen’s University [Senate Policy on Student Debtors](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/senate/policy-student-debtors) provides that:
_Any student with an overdue debt with the University will not be permitted to register or receive examination results, official transcripts or marks reports until the outstanding account is settled in full or until an acceptable arrangement for settling the account is made. In no case will a diploma be released to a student with an outstanding debt with the University._
Students with outstanding debts may also be restricted from registering for, or attending, courses and Program residential sessions until all debts have been paid in full or an acceptable arrangement for the payment of debt has been reached.
Interest will be charged to the student account on any overdue amount. Interest is calculated on a compound basis. Account queries should be addressed to the Smith Finance Office at [**Queen's Smith School of Business**](mailto:businessoffice@queensu.ca)**.**
* * *
##### 7.7 Trademark and Copyright
Smith School of Business is the owner of its trademarks (logo, name, colours) and custom materials (workbooks, study guides, cases). Smith School of Business retains ownership of all trademarks and copyrights, and students may not duplicate or reproduce these trademarks and copyrights without specific written permission from the Dean of Smith School of Business and the Program Director. This is particularly important regarding the use of the logo, which may not be reproduced on clothing or other materials without the prior written consent of the Dean and the Program Director. The School assumes no responsibility for any costs incurred by students who proceed to use the School logo without receiving prior written permission. Persons who use the School trademark and copyrights without permission will be subject to legal action to block usage. 
* * *
##### 7.8 Travel Insurance
Health insurance that covers international travel is necessary for all persons participating in international activities to protect them from significant financial problems while abroad and to ensure optimal emergency health care. It is your sole responsibility to ensure you have health insurance that covers international travel.
## APPENDIX A – ACADEMIC APPEALS COMMITTEE OF FACULTY BOARD
**Smith School of Business 
Master of Business Administration, Master of Management, and Graduate Diploma Programs** 
_Adopted by Faculty Board September 12, 2017_
##### TERMS OF REFERENCE
First appeals of academic decisions are made to the Academic Progress Committee of the program in which the student is enrolled (i.e. the Undergraduate Academic Progress Committee or the MBA/MOM Academic Progress Committee). These committees are knowledgeable about the particular program, school, and university regulations, and have experience making student academic and progress decisions.
First appeals of instructors’ decisions regarding academic integrity are normally made to the Academic Integrity Panel (AIP). However, in the event that the AIP is the original decision-maker3, the first appeal of the AIP decision is to the Academic Appeals Committee.
The decision responsibilities set out above are in accordance with the Senate's Policy on Student Appeals, Rights and Discipline, which recognizes that "decisions should generally be made by those who are most familiar with the context”4.
The Academic Appeals Committee (AAC) is established by the Smith School of Business and created by Faculty Board to:
1. Review, hear, and dispose of student academic appeals from decisions of Academic Progress Committees regarding academic matters and student progress, including but not limited to academic probation, requirements to withdraw, and other related decisions;
2. Review, hear, and dispose of student appeals from decisions of the Academic Integrity Panel regarding:
 1. The Finding of Departure from Academic Integrity;
 2. The sanction(s) resulting from a Finding of Departure from Academic Integrity; or
 3. Finding and sanction if both issues are raised on appeal.
3. Make recommendations to Academic Progress Committees, Program Administration, or the Academic Integrity Panel regarding matters of policy arising from AAC discussions and hearings; and
4. Serve as the final body of academic appeal in the Smith School of Business.
_3 For a description of the circumstances in which the Academic Integrity Panel might be the original decision maker, see the Smith School of Business Academic Integrity Policy, Section 3.2(b) 
4 Senate Policy on Student Appeals, Rights, and Discipline, Introduction._
##### 1\. JURISDICTION
The AAC has jurisdiction over all academic matters related to appeals involving students registered in the Smith School of Business, except students in the MSc and PhD programs who are governed by the School of Graduate Studies General Regulations.
Normally, the AAC shall serve as a true appeal board, which reviews the decision of the previous decision- making body based on the same information available to the previous body at the time the decision was made.
In this context, the AAC shall consider appeals alleging:
1. A failure by the relevant decision-making body to follow applicable Smith School of Business rules or regulations;
2. A breach of procedural fairness;
3. A violation of University policies;
4. The decision of the previous decision-making body was not reasonable5.
In cases where the original decision was made by the Academic Integrity Panel, the AAC shall conduct a hearing de novo, which is a new hearing of the matter conducted as though the original hearing had not taken place6. 
_6[The Senate Policy on Student Appeals Rights and Discipline](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/senate/student-academic-appeals-policy), in commentary to Section 16, defines ‘reasonable’ as follows: “\[A\] decision that is grounded in logic…. \[A\] reasonable decision is one that is supported by logical inferences from accepted premises and facts.” The commentary further notes that “\[i\]f there is more than one conclusion that may be reasonably drawn from the same premises and facts, the choice of one conclusion over another does not make the decision unreasonable.” This is the sense in which “reasonable” is used here._
_7 Section 4.4 of the [Senate Policy on Academic Integrity Procedures,](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/senate/academic-integrity-procedures-requirements-faculties-schools) stipulates that “The first appeal of an academic integrity decision shall always be a hearing de novo.” A hearing de novo means a new and complete consideration of all available evidence, followed by the issuance of a new decision._
##### 2\. MEMBERSHIP
The MBA/MOM Academic Progress Committee is comprised of a total of seven voting members, all of whom are knowledgeable about the MBA, MOM and GD programs. APC members are faculty members of Smith School of Business and are appointed by the Associate Dean, Faculty. Two faculty members are appointed Co-Chairs.
Members normally hold a term of three years (preferably in staggered terms). New members assume their duties on July 1 of each year.
Hearing Panels of the MBA/MOM APC shall be appointed by the Co-Chair to hear individual student appeals. Hearing Panels shall normally consist of a minimum of three APC members, including one CoChair, and a maximum of six APC members, based on availability and any conflict of interest issues.
**2.1 THE ROLE OF THE CO-CHAIR** 
The Co-Chairs of the APC will be faculty members. Another member of the APC may be delegated the role of Co-Chair if the appointed Co-Chairs are unable to participate in a particular case
Normally, one Co-Chair will act as Chair of a Hearing Panel. The Co-Chair will:
i. appoint a Hearing Panel; 
ii. serve as the Chair of a Hearing Panel, unless that role is delegated as above; 
iii. convene hearings; 
iv. preside over hearings of the MBA/MOM APC Panel according to the Rules of Procedure5 and give procedural direction for the conduct of individual cases to the extent that a procedural issue is not dealt with in the Rules of Procedure;

## APPENDIX B – ACADEMIC PROGRESS COMMITTEE RULES OF PROCEDURE
**Smith School of Business 
Master of Business Administration, Master of Management, and Graduate Diploma Programs** 
_Adopted by Faculty Board September 12, 2017_ 
**RULES OF PROCEDURE**
##### **1\. GENERAL RULES**
The following rules apply to proceedings before an APC Hearing ("Panel"):
**1.1 PANEL DECISIONS WILL BE MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH RELEVANT SCHOOL REGULATIONS AND POLICIES** 
The Panel will adhere to the relevant program Academic Regulations as well as policies and procedures of the School and Queen’s University.
**1.2 ALL APPEALS ARE TO BE HEARD BY THE PANEL _IN CAMERA_** 
To protect the privacy and confidentiality of students, Panel meetings and Hearings are closed to the public. 
Hearings are not normally recorded, unless a special request is made by the appellant in advance of the Hearing. In such a case, the Chair of the Panel (“Chair”) will decide whether to record the Hearing. The Chair may also wish to record a Hearing, and will inform the parties of the intention to do so in advance of the Hearing. Any transcripts of a Hearing will be provided to either party upon request, in which case a copy will also be provided to the other party. Transcripts must be treated as confidential. There will be no recording of the Panel’s deliberations. Participants may take their own notes during the Hearing. All such notes are transitory1 and are not considered to be University Records. 
**1.3 NO CONFLICT OF INTEREST** 
In cases where an APC member has, or may be reasonably perceived to have, a conflict of interest with respect to a specific case, that individual may not serve on the APC Panel in connection with that case2.
**1.4 No member will participate in the deliberations or final Decision of the Panel unless present for the entire Appeal Hearing** 
**1.5 SUPPLEMENTARY RULES OF PROCEDURE** 
As needed, the Chair has the power to issue such supplementary rules of procedure as may be necessary to govern the conduct of an Appeal.
* * *
1See the Queen’s University Policy on Transitory Records: https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/guidance/fact-sheets/transitory-records Transitory Records are created or received by the University in the course of conducting its activities, but have no ongoing operational, informational, evidential or historical value. Usually transitory records have an immediate or short-term value, pertaining to an immediate task or minor transaction. They can exist in any format or medium. An example is an e-mail confirming attendance at a meeting. 
2 Normally, having taught the appellant in a class that is neither directly the subject of the appeal nor indirectly the subject of the appeal is not considered a conflict of interest and does not require that the APC member recuse themselves. A conflict of interest may be present if: there is a relationship between the APC member and the student (such as a consulting or family relationship); the APC member has an interest in the outcome of the decision; the APC member has pre-judged the case; the APC member was involved in an earlier stage of decision-making. In cases where a conflict is unclear, the remaining members of the APC will determine if the member should be recused.
**1.6 The Panel has no power to compel any person to attend a hearing**  
The Chair may request the participation of parties and witnesses, but it has no power to compel participation.
##### **2\. APPEAL HEARING** 
A student wishing to appeal an academic decision made at the Program level has a right to a Hearing before an APC Hearing Panel. In such a case, the student has seven (7) days following the date of the Program’s decision to provide the APC Co-Chair with written confirmation that they wish to appeal the Program’s decision (“Notice of Appeal”).
**2.1 Written Submissions6** 
After indicating their intention to appeal, the student will have a further 14 days following the date on their Notice of Appeal to provide the APC Co-Chair with a full written Submission. 
i. The Student’s Submission: The student’s Submission should outline their situation, include any and all pertinent evidence, a list of any witnesses the student intends to bring to the Appeal Hearing, and the student’s desired remedy for the situation. 
ii. The Director’s Submission: The Co-Chair of the APC will share the Student’s Submission with the Program Director, who will have seven (7) days following receipt of the Student’s Submission to respond with their own written Submission if they wish. The Program Director’s Submission should include the reasons for their decision, any pertinent evidence, and a list of any witnesses they intend to bring to the Appeal Hearing.  
iii. The Student’s Response: The Program Director’s Submission will be shared with the student who will have seven (7) days following receipt of the Director’s Submission to submit a final written Statement to the APC Co-Chair if they wish. 
**2.2 The Proceeding** 
Following the receipt of all written Submissions, the Co-Chair shall appoint the members of the Hearing Panel7 and schedule the Appeal Hearing. The student shall be given sufficient notice of the date, time and location of the Hearing, as well as the names of all participants, and their role, in at the Hearing. The Hearing will be conducted in an appropriate space.  
i. The student has the right to appear in-person, electronically, or to opt not to appear at the Hearing.  
ii. A Hearing may proceed and a decision made without additional input from the student in cases where the student opts not to appear at their Hearing. 
iii. The student has the right to representation, including a Dispute Resolution Advisor from the Ombudsman’s Office and/or legal counsel and/or other agent (all at the student’s own expense) at the Appeal Hearing. The student may make oral submissions or their representative may make submissions on their behalf. The student must inform the Chair of the name and role of any representatives in advance of the Hearing. 
iv. Normally the Program Director or their delegate will attend the Hearing and make oral submissions. The Program Director may also bring representation who may make submissions on their behalf.  
v. Other witnesses will be asked to participate in the Hearing as deemed necessary by the Chair. Witnesses are individuals who have first-hand knowledge of the matters at issue in the Appeal Hearing; the evidence of ‘character’ witnesses will not normally be received by the Panel. Each party shall have an opportunity to question witnesses. The Chair can limit questioning of a witness if the Chair believes the questioning is irrelevant, abusive or otherwise inappropriate.  
vi. The Chair shall determine what evidence is admitted as part of the Hearing. The Chair shall normally apply a relevance approach8 to such determinations. The Chair has the right to exclude evidence that is deemed irrelevant, repetitive or otherwise inappropriate. 
vii.  If, during the course of the Hearing, the Chair decides that more information is required in order to clarify a matter, the Chair may adjourn the Hearing to permit the relevant parties to bring forward such information or facts or to permit the Panel to obtain such information. 
viii. The Chair may decide to adjourn the Hearing at the request of a party if the Chair believes that a party may be unfairly prejudiced should the Hearing proceed. 
ix. The Panel has the right to seek confirmation and/or verification of any evidence, claims, or submissions made by any participants in the Hearing; should it be determined that false information was provided to the Panel, the matter may be investigated under the Smith School of Business Academic Integrity Policy.
* * *
6Note that in complex cases, additional time may be required. The Co-Chair has the power to make exceptions to the stated timeframes as appropriate based on the complexity of the case. Parties must make requests for additional time to the Co-Chair as soon as they determine the need for additional time. 
7Hearing Panels shall normally consist of a minimum of three APC members and a maximum of all APC members based on availability and any conflict of interest issues.
##### **3\. THE DECISION**  
After hearing all evidence, the AAC will deliberate _in camera._  The deliberations of the AAC are confidential.
Following deliberations, the Panel may: 
i. Dismiss the appeal and uphold the previous decision. In the case that the student be required to withdraw, a formal letter advising the student of the requirement to withdraw will be issued; or, 
ii. Allow the appeal and grant the remedy requested by the student; or, 
iii. Allow the Appeal in part and modify the Program’s original decision, and impose an appropriate sanction. This may include:
* Imposing specific conditions under which the student will be permitted to continue in the Program and/or any requirements the student must meet, including the timelines within which such conditions and/or requirements must be met;
* Requiring the student to:
 * Complete additional work;
 * Repeat an exam, assignment, or course;
 * Achieve a minimum grade(s);
 * Provide evidence of fitness to continue in the Program;
 * Placing the student on Academic Probation until the student satisfies all conditions and/or requirements within the timeline(s) set by the AAC.
iv. Impose other terms and/or conditions as may be appropriate for the specific situation.
The Panel may not award financial compensation to a student. The Panel’s Decision shall be communicated to the student within seven (7) days, or within a reasonable time as demanded by the complexity of the case, via a Decision Letter from the Panel Chair. The Decision Letter will include the reasons for the Decision, information about the next level of appeal, to whom to address an appeal, and information about the availability of the support of the Office of the University Ombudsman. 
The Panel’s Decision Letter shall be the official record of the Appeal. The Decision Letter will include the effective date of any actions to be taken by the Program (see section 3). 
##### **4\. POST-HEARING MATTERS**
In accordance with the [Senate Policy on Student Appeals, Rights and Discipline](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/senate/student-academic-appeals-policy), section 20, the student is normally entitled to exhaust all levels of appeal before sanctions are applied, except in the rare case where it is determined that the interests of third parties may be prejudiced by the continued enrolment of the student in a course or program. In such a case, the AAC shall determine whether the student may continue in their Program until appeal processes are exhausted. If the student is permitted to continue, the AAC shall determine under what conditions the student may do so, having regard for the need to protect the interests of the third party/parties. The AAC shall address the effective date of any actions and/or sanctions in the Decision Letter.
##### 5: RECORDS MANAGEMENT
Appeal Records consist of all documents filed by the parties, the recording, if any, of the Appeal Hearing(s), the transcript, if any, of the recording, and the Decision Letter issued by the Panel.
**5.1 RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CO-CHAIR** 
The APC Co-Chair or delegate is responsible for collecting and distributing Appeal Records. The Co-Chair shall handle such records in a secure manner which protects the confidentiality of the documents.
Following an Appeal Hearing and issuance of the Decision Letter, the Panel Chair shall collect the files and any notes made during the Hearing by Panel members. All such notes are transitory and are not considered to be University Records. They form no part of the Appeal Record and shall be destroyed immediately following the issuance of the Panel’s Decision. 
**5.2 RECORDS RETENTION** 
Once the Panel renders its decision: 
i. The Decision Letter is the official record of the Decision, a copy of which shall be kept by the APC 
Co-Chair, the Program Director and in the Dean’s Office. 
ii. Original Appeal Records are to be kept by the APC Co-Chair for one (1) year following the date 
on which the student has exhausted all levels of appeal at the University, or, for one (1) year 
following the expiry of the deadline for the student to pursue an appeal, whichever occurs first. 
iii. Transitory records may be destroyed 
Appeals of these decisions are made to the Academic Appeals Committee.

3. Classify Records
The [Directory of Records](http://records-retention.library.queensu.ca/directory-records.php) provides a file classification scheme for the organization of university records in all media. Organized records are easy to file and to retrieve when needed.  Departments and units should use this scheme to develop a classification plan specific to their own records.  Using the pre-determined scheme has the advantage of being linked to the Records Retention Schedules which tell you how long to keep the records and when and how to dispose of them.
The file classification plan lists the records in a particular department or unit. It should be reviewed and updated regularly so that any new types or series of records are included and obsolete classifications are removed. The completed file classification plan tells everyone in the department or unit where to file documents in paper files and in electronic files and folders. In addition, it would be used for:
* creating labels for paper file folders in a paper filing system
* creating a shared directory structure for the unit
* creating a folder structure for email
* filing documents within paper and electronic files and folders

# [3 Steps to Smart Gift Giving](https://www.queensu.ca/grad-postdoc/graduate-studies/gradifying-blog/3-steps-smart-gift-giving) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/grad-postdoc/graduate-studies/gradifying-blog/3-steps-smart-gift-giving_

As we approach the holiday season, I want to delve into the art of gift-giving as a graduate student. Contrary to popular belief, being a fantastic gift giver doesn't necessarily mean breaking the bank. It's more about the effort you put into understanding the other person's needs and desires. So, while it may not cost much money, being a fantastic gift giver does take effort!
Before thinking about the actual gifts, it's crucial to have a realistic budget that aligns with your means. Equally important is knowing the person you're gifting. Once these two pillars are in place, you're ready to follow the next steps and apply them to every gift-giving situation.
**Step 1: The Useful Gift**
That's where you usually spend the most money, but you can handmake or thrift gifts, too! The useful gift is about **improving the other person's life**, whether through a desire or a necessity. Depending on who they are and their lifestyle, this could mean vastly different things. Observe their habits, hobbies and interests to get clues. Create a list on your phone to note these down whenever you notice something. Here are some of my suggestions:
* The skincare lover: go to [Maneko Living](https://www.instagram.com/maneko_living/?hl=en) and buy a new sunscreen for them to try. You can find some good options around $12 + tax.
* The practical one: restock their toiletries (just trust me). Or sock drawer. The [Adidas outlet](https://www.instagram.com/adidaskingston/) has some great, affordable options. Register for the Adidas Club and show your student ID for a discount.
* The homebody: get them the [coziest and cutest sleepers](https://blnts.com/collections/bn_womens-sleepwear_slippers-1?srsltid=AfmBOorLD_lzf4uMZMkT7Sn7ODzifxnwxk2kvT5CCZ6Ozkzkl_B1bNH1) from Bluenotes, starting from $8 + tax. If you go in person to one of their stores, you get a coupon to participate in a giveaway.
* The crafter: go to dollar and thrift stores, gather supplies, and arrange them into a nice basket.
* The minimalist: get them the [most perfect cotton t-shirt](https://www.uniqlo.com/ca/en/products/E465185-000?colorCode=COL09&sizeCode=SMA002) from Uniqlo.
* The meal prepper: finding a good lunch bag is hard. Staples has some good models, but this [one is my favourite—it's spacious and leakproof](https://www.staples.ca/products/503253-en-swiss-gear-insulated-2-compartment-lunch-bag-black).  
* The tea aficionado: visit [Cha Cha Tea](https://www.chachatea.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoozmxIzKw3y2uWkw52yG3lnqyn-uDqkhTa-B14OmoaABTOKLxRF) and ask Kaoru-san for a recommendation. Or get the Eternally Nuts blend - the best tea ever. If they already have a favourite, you can choose a tea accessory like an infuser or a cute cup.
**Step 2: The Fun Gift**
The fun gift is all about **bringing joy to the person you're gifting.** It's the most straightforward category, and you can even combine it with the other gift categories. The key is to ensure the fun component is there. I personally like to include their favourite candy in the packaging, just to add an extra element of fun.
**Step 3: The Intimate Gift**
The purpose of the intimate gift is to **show the other person you are connected**. Different people react and show love (independently if it's romantic, friendship, etc.) differently. I usually go for a self-made card with heartfelt words about the person, what I like about them and what I wish for the upcoming year. You can sing or play them a song, recite poetry, make a customized calendar or photo collage, give them coupons for activities with you, send them their favourite flowers, ask them to dance – endless possibilities!
However you decide to distribute the "weights" of each category, don't forget the packaging! I said three steps, but this is essential to the experience component. The dollar store, YouTube and Pinterest tutorials are your best friends here. Also, while you're giving them their gift(s), be sure to explain the purpose behind each aspect. You can tell a little story about what you noticed about them and why you chose that gift. Be creative and resourceful! They will definitely feel seen and appreciated, making the gift even more special.

 _https://www.queensu.ca/academics/programs?certifications%5B27%5D=27_

The **Art History** program offers degrees at the undergraduate and graduate level. Art History courses offer students a unique opportunity to develop the essential skill of visual literacy -- learning to look carefully and think critically about the visual images and material objects that surround us. Encompassing global art traditions from prehistory to the present, courses introduce students to a range of interdisciplinary methods, topics, and media. We explore how visual and material culture shapes human society across time and around the world. Queen's Art History students can take advantage of experiential learning opportunities in Venice (Venice Summer School/Venice and Its Biennale) and at [Bader College](https://www.queensu.ca/badercollege/), our 15th-century castle in England, in addition to internships for course credit at the Agnes Etherington Art Centre on campus and in other museums across Canada. Research opportunities abound at Queen's which is home to the magnificent Bader Collection of European art as well as collections of contemporary, Indigenous, African, and Canadian art. Through field trips, internships, and other activities in and out of the classroom, students gain first-hand experience in analyzing and interpreting works of art and architecture in preparation for careers in museums and archives, academic institutions, heritage preservation and tourism, journalism, art business, art law, and cultural policy.
The **Art Conservation** program is offered at the graduate level only. It is the only Master of Art Conservation program in Canada. Art conservation is an exciting and challenging multidisciplinary field that involves the examination, interpretation, analysis, and treatment of cultural, historical, and artistic objects. Professional conservators rely on their knowledge of both the humanities and the sciences in order to understand the creation and production of material culture in the past and present and to ensure its preservation for future generations.
Queen's Biology students have the opportunity to explore the full breadth of biology: the inner workings of cells; the integrative biology of organisms; the interactions between organisms in ecological communities; and the central roles of genetics and evolution in shaping the diversity of life. Hands-on laboratory exercises, field courses offered locally at our renowned [Queen’s University Biological Station](https://qubs.ca/home) and around the world, and independent research opportunities in professors’ laboratories on selected topics are hallmarks of a Degree Plan in Biology. The mission of Queen’s Biology is to prepare graduating students to be engaged, independent, and critically thinking citizens, well-prepared for further study and with a variety of career options.
The Department of Chemical Engineering is dedicated to achieving the highest standard of research and teaching.

Queen’s Chemistry programs have rich practical laboratory components, where you will put into practice key concepts learned from your lectures. In upper years, you can specialize in one or more of the fundamental branches of chemistry – analytical, inorganic, organic, physical, and theoretical – or explore new applications such as environmental, materials, biological, computational, or polymer chemistry.
The Department of Civil Engineering prepares undergraduate and graduate students for a rewarding career in the dynamic profession of civil engineering. Our faculty, research and teaching staff are comprised of some of the finest minds in the fields of civil and environmental engineering. They welcome questions and collaborations with our students. Along with our students from around the world and our professional administrative staff, they work together to create an energetic and creative department.
Classics refers to the study of the Greek and Roman worlds. Multi-disciplinary in approach, it involves the studies of history, literature, archaeology, religion, mythology, drama, and philosophy, in addition to the ancient languages of Greek and Latin. Today our understanding of Greek and Roman culture is further enhanced by the latest digital techniques that increasingly pervade studies in archaeology, epigraphy, papyrology, and ancient science and medicine. At Queen’s, students have the opportunity to get hands-on experience in the latest techniques by participating in one of two archaeological excavations supervised by our own faculty, or through a variety of projects and assignments.  
For a career in business, you want the best start possible. That’s the Bachelor of Commerce at Smith. Attain a deep understanding of business strategies and concepts, including innovations that are changing the nature of work now and for the future.

The Department of Geography and Planning is an integrated department that studies the earth's places, societies, environments and landscapes. The Department is unique in bridging the social sciences and humanities (i.e., human geography) and planning with physical geography. Geography and Planning puts this understanding of social and physical processes within the context of places and regions - recognizing the great differences in cultures, political systems, economies, landscapes, and environments across the world, and the links between them. In physical geography we study natural processes, their interactions, and both naturally and human-generated environmental issues. In the social sciences we study a variety of social problems, with a special focus on the uneven distribution of resources and services at scales from the local to the global. In humanities research we explore how human beings have made, and continue to make, the places (physical, social and metaphorical) in which they live. In all these areas, Queen’s Geography and Planning has scholars and teachers of international repute who are dedicated to making a dynamic and innovative research and teaching environment and a warm and supportive interpersonal environment for our students and faculty.
Geoscientists are the interpreters of our natural world. They bring methods such as geophysics, geochemistry, geobiology, and field geology together to understand the modern and ancient Earth. Clues concealed in rocks and fossils, minerals and fluids, mountains and sediments, glaciers and volcanoes are marshaled to understand and explain the Earth system at all scales. Managing water, mineral, and energy resources, developing sustainable strategies for industrial growth, and coping with natural and anthropogenic hazards facing increasing global populations, including climate change, all depend on a deep understanding of natural processes. Our graduates study the Earth in this context, with careers in diverse fields including, but not limited to, research, mineral and oil exploration, policy analysis, environmental science, and resource management. The programs offered by this Department focus on the whole planet and global processes as a dynamic and integrated system.
Global Development Studies is an interdisciplinary degree program that empowers students to better understand and shape the driving forces of change in our interconnected world. To open up a wide range of career choices and options for further study in Canada and internationally, the program connects big-picture analysis with problem-solving approaches based on deep empirical knowledge. This unique combination gives students skill sets that help them realize their commitment to making the world a better place. Through careful analysis of contemporary challenges in the fields of poverty and livelihoods, cross-cultural communication, environmental sustainability, human rights, and indigenous studies, we help students appreciate development as a relationship rather than as a characteristic of particular places and people.
In addition to its four unique MBA programs, Smith School of Business offers many other graduate programs in specific areas of expertise including analytics, finance, international business, entrepreneurship and innovation, and accounting.

 _https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/information/research-protocols_

## Protocol for Requesting Access to Personal Information in a Queen’s University Record for a Research Purpose
### Authority
Queen’s University will comply with section 21(1)(e) of the [_Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act_](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90f31) (“FIPPA”) which authorizes the disclosure of personal information for a research purpose if:
(i) the disclosure is consistent with the conditions or reasonable expectations of disclosure under which the personal information was provided, collected or obtained,
(ii) the research purpose for which the disclosure is to be made cannot be reasonably accomplished unless the information is provided in individually identifiable form, and
(iii) the person who is to receive the record has agreed to comply with the conditions relating to security and confidentiality prescribed by the regulations. \[See [Regulation 460, section 10(1)](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/900460).\]
Requests for access to personal information in University records will be handled as formal FIPPA requests through the [Records Management and Privacy Office](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/node/14).  _Note: Requests for access to University records that have been placed in the Queen’s University Archives will be coordinated by the [University Archivist](https://archives.queensu.ca/)._
### Procedures
1\. Researchers wishing to use operational University records containing personal information for a research purpose will first consult with the University office responsible for the records to determine whether the records can be anonymized. If so, the researcher can liaise with the responsible office and is not required to submit a formal FIPPA request. _Note: University offices may wish to consult with the Records Management and Privacy Office if there is any concern about the anonymization._
2\. If anonymization is not possible, researchers will consult with the [Records Management and Privacy Office](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/node/14) in order to discuss the project and submit a formal FIPPA request for access to the records.
3\. As part of the request, the researcher will be asked to complete the Research Agreement template which will include a description of the research project, a rationale for using records in personally identifiable form, a detailed list of records to be consulted, and assurances that the records will be treated securely and confidentially. The Director, University Records Management and Chief Privacy Officer will deliberate on the merits of the application, consulting other offices within the University as appropriate. The final decision on access to records will be made by the designated decision-maker as outlined in the FIPPA Delegation of Authority.
4\. Researchers who are granted access to personal information for a research purpose will be able to access the requested records for a period of two years.

## Protocol for Requesting Access to Personal Health Information in a Queen’s University Record for a Research Purpose
[](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/sites/oapwww/files/uploaded_files/Protocol-RequestAccessTo-PHI-ForResearch.pdf) [Protocol for Requesting Access to Personal Health Information in a Queen's University Record for a Research Purpose (PDF, 189 KB)](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/sites/oapwww/files/uploaded_files/Protocol-RequestAccessTo-PHI-ForResearch.pdf)
The Tri-Council Policy Statement on Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans—known as [TCPS2 (2018)](https://ethics.gc.ca/eng/policy-politique_tcps2-eptc2_2018.html) —requires the approval of a Research Ethics Board (REB) for secondary use of information for a research purpose. Secondary use means using information collected originally for a purpose other than the current research purpose, such as records created for administration or operations, or records created for a different research project. Article 5.5 requires that REB approval be sought for the secondary use of both identifiable information and de-identified/anonymized information. Article 5.5A specifically permits the use of identifiable information without consent under certain circumstances.
Personal health information is, by definition, identifiable information. (_If information is not identifiable (e.g., if it has been de-identified or anonymized), then it is not personal health information and this protocol does not apply._) The Personal Health Information Protection Act (“PHIPA”) permits the disclosure of personal health information by a **Health Information Custodian**, or **HIC**, for a research purpose in situations where it is impractical for the researcher to seek consent from the individuals to whom the information relates.
In accordance with section 44(1) of PHIPA, Queen’s University’s HICs (see Schedule A below) may authorize disclosure of personal health information for a research purpose if the researcher:
1. submits to the University:
 * an application in writing,
 * a research plan that meets the requirements of section 44(2) of PHIPA, and
 * a copy of the decision of a research ethics board that approves the research plan; and
2. enters into the agreement required by section 44(5).
The **flow chart below** outlines the process for accessing records containing personal health information from a Queen’s University HIC. Researchers with a connection to Queen’s University will follow the normal process for approval through a research ethics board with the goal of obtaining a data transfer agreement. Researchers without a connection to Queen’s University will apply through the University’s Privacy Office with the goal of obtaining a research agreement.
Access to records containing personal health information that have been transferred to the Queen’s University Archives will be coordinated by the University Archivist.
N.B. Requests from individuals for access to their own PHI can be treated in accordance with normal unit access procedures or as a FIPPA request through the Records Management and Privacy Office.

Full courses  (6.0 credit units) designated as Studies and half courses  (3.0 credit units) designated as Topics offer the study of a single work, a group of related works, an author or authors within the period or grouping indicated. The content of these offerings will vary from year to year. Not all the courses listed below will be offered in any one year, and a few are offered infrequently. A list of expected offerings with detailed descriptions of course content will be sent to applicants as soon as it can be drawn up.  
**ENGL 800 Introduction to Professional and Pedagogical Skills I**  
This course introduces M.A. and M.Phil. students to the scholarly study and teaching of English literature. The emphasis will be on training Teaching Assistants. There will be practical training in research skills, essay-marking, the academic counselling of students, and first-time teaching. There will also be some consideration of academic and non-academic careers for M.A.s and MPhils. Three term-hours; fall.  
**ENGL 802 Practical Criticism** 
This course will provide students with the necessary tools to practice and to teach "close reading" in a broad range of genres from different historical and national contexts.  Students will engage in textual analysis through a series of practical exercises combined with readings of critical essays representing different approaches to the reading of literature.  Not offered 2024-25.

**ENGL 813 Literary Theory III**  
Topic:  Writing the Body  
This advanced interdisciplinary seminar course introduces students to contemporary readings in Black studies, Indigenous Studies, colonialism, queer and trans studies in relation to the body. We might think about the body as a physical manifestation, a material being, one in relation, one that takes up space, or not. How might we orientate ourselves as we bear witness to those whose presence clamors for attention in the social and political periphery? In this course we’ll be thinking about what it is to write the body (both as an act of legibility, and as political practice of inclusion or exclusion) first through Franz Fanon and Audre Lorde, but branching out to think with other thinkers, artists, poets, and novelists to ask: how is a body--or how are we—articulated, or not? What are the limits of legibility, of opacity? What are the archives of those whose presences remain unwritten, or unrecognized, in practices of knowledge and power? As we consider these questions collectively through the critical reading, discussion, and reflection, we hope to expand the idea of the body beyond the material form to think alongside conceptions of containment, power, and resistance. Three term-hours; winter. 
**ENGL 815 Topics in Literary Study I** 
Topic: The Novel in the Anthropocene 
Three term-hours; winter.
**ENGL 816 Topics in Literary Study II** 
Not offered 2024-25.
**ENGL 817 Topics in Literary Studies III**  
Topic: Publishing Practicum 
Description: This seminar takes students through revision and submission stages from draft essay to article publication. The first section of the course will be devoted to discussion of the differences between coursework papers and published articles, and to a presentation and peer revision cycle of each student’s work. The second section of the course will discuss how to decide where to send article submissions, how to present them, and what to expect of the process. If there is time, we will build in a conference proposal/presentation stage. Students must have a complete draft essay to bring to the start of the course and be ready to welcome reading and response from peers. Success in the course requires regular attendance, constructive participation, revision responsive to instructor and peer review, and submission to an appropriate scholarly venue for publication. Note: Doctoral students are strongly urged to enroll in this course, and while the course is open to all students, doctoral students will have enrolment priority. Three term-hours; winter.  
**ENGL 818 Topics in Literary Study IV** 
Topic: Pulp 
This course descends into the lurid world of pulp fiction in the early twentieth century, torch in hand, to explore the historical emergence of sensational genres such as crime, horror, science fiction, and fantasy adventure, in literature and comics. We will study them, curse them, and revel in them as outlandish experiments with normative ways of thinking about self and society, rivalling those of the high-culture avant-garde. We’ll consult mad scientists, muscled barbarians, woman robots, tentacled monsters, femme fatales, and many more denizens of this barely restrained, rarely woke, modern imagination. Three term-hours; winter.

**ENGL 823 Studies in Medieval Literature** 
Not offered 2024-25.
**ENGL 824 Topics in Medieval Literature I** 
Topic: King Arthur: Medieval to Modern 
This course will examine a selection of Arthurian texts, beginning with the earliest Welsh legends and then following the tradition into the present day. Works to be read include selections from major interpreters of the legend over a period of 900 years, including Geoffrey of Monmouth, Sir Thomas Malory, Alfred Lord Tennyson and T. H. White. Apart from these better-known writers, many other authors and poets have employed Arthurian themes and narratives in their work, and students will be asked to research some of these versions, and to present on the results of their research. We will thus be able to piece together a history of the tradition that includes a variety of high cultural and popular interpretations of the narrative over time. Throughout the course, we will return to the following central questions: What cultural purposes do myths of King Arthur serve? Whose values do they reflect? To what extent do they engage with the early medieval past, and to what extent with the concerns of their later interpreters? Three term-hours; winter.
**ENGL 825 Topics in Medieval Literature II**

**ENGL 832 Topics in Early Modern Literature and Culture II** 
Topic: Shakespeare and Sovereignty. 
“Sovereign is he who decides on the exception,” wrote the Weimar Republic and later Nazi jurist Carl Schmitt, at the beginning of his _Political Theology_ in 1922. “Not all the water in the rough, rude sea can wash the balm off from an anointed king,” proclaims Shakespeare’s King Richard II, asserting his lawful kingship even as he is deposed by his cousin Henry Bolingbroke in the play that another German jurist, Ernst Kantorowicz, used to mount a post-war critique of Schmitt’s arguments. Throughout his canon, Shakespeare demonstrates fascination with the sovereign and the basis of sovereignty, particularly as it emerges _in extremis,_ in conditions of emergency or exception, querying from whence sovereignty derives, and how it is (re)established once consensus about its locations and norms is lost. In this course we will consider five plays by Shakespeare, _Richard II, Henry IV, Parts One_ and _Two, Measure for Measure_ and _King Lear,_ in relation to two problems of modern and post-modern political theory: political theology and bio-politics as they are developed in the writings of Schmitt and Kantorowicz, as well Schmitt’s recent exponent, Giorgio Agamben, and Michel Foucault.  What is the role of divine authority, metaphysics, custom and human agency in establishing a right to rule? What is the sovereign the sovereign of?  What limitations, claims, and affordances does human embodiment impose or confer on the sovereign?  How do formal choices in dramatic representation inflect ideas about the sovereignty? The term in which we undertake this exploration will coincide with the run-up to a US election which many feel could bring the international liberal order into a state of exception. What better time to take a long view of sovereignty? Three term-hours; fall.
**ENGL 833 Topics in Early Modern Literature and Culture III**  
Not offered 2024-25.

**ENGL 840 Studies in Restoration and Eighteenth-Century Literature** 
Not offered 2024-25.
**ENGL 841 Topics in Restoration and Eighteenth-Century Literature I** 
Topic: Eighteenth-Century Women’s Poetry 
Changes in social and economic arrangements (from the court to the city, from the aristocracy to the middle class), especially developments in the publishing industry, in education, in attitudes toward publication, brought about new opportunities for women writers over the course of the “long eighteenth century” (roughly 1660-1800). This course offers an introduction to the principles of 18th-century poetry by way of questions of gender. The first half looks at famous debates about gender and authorship between male and female authors. The second half will be student-directed, looking to thematic concerns in women’s poetry specifically. Three term-hours; fall. 
**ENGL 842 Topics in Restoration and Eighteenth-Century Literature II** 
Topic: Epistolarity in the Eighteenth Century  
You’ve got mail! The trope of a bag of letters opened to the reader’s gaze is surprisingly common in eighteenth-century literature. This course looks at a selection of eighteenth-century letters, letter-writing manuals, famous newspaper correspondence, and fictions and dramas that depend upon letters to examine what makes epistolary form so fascinating. Texts will include works by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Samuel Richardson, Tobias Smollett, and others. Three term-hours; winter

Topic: The Literature of Addiction.  
According to Stuart Walton in _Out of It_ (2002), some addicts commit suicide and others overdose. There is, however, a third group that manages to avoid both these fates and stay alive. Its members are “the ones who may well go on to write abuse confessionals”, Walton adds, “and each is a distant descendant of De Quincey.” This course examines De Quincey’s seminal narratives of drug addiction, including _Confessions of an English Opium-Eater_ and its sequel, _Suspiria de Profundis_. It then explores the work of some of De Quincey’s major “descendants”, including Edgar Allan Poe, Arthur Conan Doyle, Virginia Woolf, Malcolm Lowry, Aldous Huxley, and Carlyn Zwarenstein. Three term-hours; fall.

**ENGL 863 Topics in Modernism III** 
Topic: Modernist Sacred Ecologies 
Friedrich Nietzsche writes in 1882—the year both Virginia Woolf and James Joyce were born—“God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. . . . With what water could we purify ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we need to invent?” (_The Gay Science_). His startling pronouncements had enduring effects on nascent modernist aesthetics and ethics, and most critics agree that Nietzsche helped to herald an age of spiritual and religious uncertainty. Still, there is another side to this story. Interest in the religious, in various forms of divinity, in mysticism, and in spiritualities remained strong, and new forms of attention to the sacred are also central to modernist literature. At the same time, the decades following the 1880s also saw increasing awareness about the precarity of the natural world. The term “ecology” (Ökologie) was coined in 1866 by the German scientist, Ernst Haeckel, and this presaged new understandings about the delicate balance between the human and the natural environment.  In this course we will consider how a range of modernist writers render sacred experience in juxtaposition and in dialogue with both local and broader ecologies. Our focus will primarily be poetry, but we will also read fiction, philosophy, theology, theory, and criticism. Writers will likely include Gerard Manley Hopkins, Emily Dickinson, Rabindranath Tagore, W.B. Yeats, T.S. Eliot, E.E. Cummings, Evelyn Underhill, Virginia Woolf, Friedrich Nietzsche, the Buddha, Augustine of Hippo, and Rainer Maria Rilke. Three term-hours; spring.

**ENGL 865 Topics in Contemporary Literature and Culture I**  
Not offered 2024-25. 
 
**ENGL 866 Topics in Contemporary Literature and Culture II** 
Topic: History and the Contemporary Novel 
This course will focus on the historical dimension of the contemporary novel.  We will explore historical fiction, the novel’s engagement with history and with questions of historical truth, and the interplay between the personal and the historical in recent fiction writing.  Works for this course are chosen to represent a broad historical and geographical range. Theorizations of the historical novel as well as the historical contexts of works on the syllabus will be studied in detail.  The international list of authors on the syllabus (from the U.K., Ireland, New Zealand, Israel, Spain, the U.S., South Africa and Germany) will include works by the following authors:  John Fowles, Claire Keegan, Damon Galgut, Lloyd Jones, A. B. Yehoshua, Javier Cercas, Jenny Erpenbeck, Graeme Mcrae Burnet, and Deborah Levy. Three term-hours; fall.

Not offered 2024-25.
**ENGL 874 Topics in Canadian Literature IV** 
Topic:  Literary Place and Space in Canada 
This graduate course examines narratives from diaspora, Indigenous and settler populations in Canada that highlight territorial claiming, whether it be in rural or urban environments, and in forms as varied as traditional Indigenous stories or hip hop’s practice of “reppin’ ”. In the landmark 1997 land claim Delgamuukw vs. British Columbia, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that traditional Indigenous story was admissible in court as evidence of land ownership, legitimizing a kind of literary land claim. How do the narratives in question claim land, and what does that say about the various communities? What are the politics of claiming stolen land, and how do class, race, cultural practice, gender and sexuality play into questions of territorial belonging, nationhood and connection to place? Three term-hours; fall.

There are many ways you can get involved in German beyond the classroom. You can come to a German film screening during LLCU International Film night. You can watch German movies from Stauffer Library's robust streaming and DVD film collection. You can attend potlucks at the Queen’s University International Centre in order to immerse yourself in other cultures and get to know exchange students from Germany!
### Queen's International Centre
 [The Queen’s University International Centre](https://quic.queensu.ca/) (QUIC) is an international education support service for students, faculty and staff at Queen’s. Through its activities the Centre promotes an internationally informed and cross culturally sensitive university community.
QUIC programs and services support
* the academic and personal development of international students, other international members of the Queen’s community, and their families;
* the academic and personal development of Queen’s students, staff and faculty interested in Education Abroad; and
* the internationalization of the campus by working with university departments, offices, groups and individuals to enhance and diversify the international learning environment at Queen’s through educational and training activities.
QUIC offers many cultural events and get-togethers for students, as well as the opportunity to volunteer to support international students with improving their English as they integrate into Queen’s life.  It is a fruitful way to meet other students from other countries, to help and to learn from one another.
 
 Check [QUIC's Calendar of Events](https://quic.queensu.ca/events/) for the most up-to-date information.
### LinguaeLive
LinguaeLive was founded by Queen's University professor [Dr. Jennifer Hosek](https://www.queensu.ca/llcu/people-search/jennifer-ruth-hosek). LinguaeLive connects people learning each other’s language; it is a tool developed by teachers for students to work with peers in complementary language classes, no matter how far away. They can communicate using any method, such as VOIP or Chat.
Many of the students who used LinguaeLive are still in touch with their partners even after they graduate, and some finally get to meet their partners in person! And many continue to learn their target languages and cultures through their friendship after graduation.
For more information, please watch [LinguaeLive - Life without Subtitles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq2_b4i29Fk).
### German Film Night
Films in German and with English subtitles are screened throughout the academic year either as part of the LLCU International Film Night or a German Film course (such as GRMN 428).
These screenings are open to all students and Kingston public.
You can also check our news section for the most updated event information.
### Student Clubs
With approximately 450 student clubs to choose from, you can easily enhance what you learn in the classroom and have  the chance to embrace your passions. More than 100 cultural and ethnic student clubs and organizations foster diversity and cultural engagement on campus. Below is AMS (Alma Mater Society) club that may be of interest to students of German:
[World Languages Club](https://myams.org/home/clubs/clubs-directory/) hosts cultural and discussion events that bring together students of a common linguistic background and/or interest, regardless of academic concentration. The majority of our events are nights dedicated to one language (determined by popular demand) with a cultural theme (for example, Oktoberfest for German; Lunar New Year for Chinese). Students of all abilities are welcome, as the administration of these discussion-events will utilize an innovative “rotation method” for discussions. Participants will grouped by language ability level, and will rotate between conversing with those at their own level, teaching/being taught something new by those of another level, and thematic/game-style discussion in a large group. Holistic multilingual events will also be hosted, celebrating the universal characteristics of language, international exchange, and benefits of multilingualism. All events will include the presentation of cultural foods, either prepared by the executive committee or assembled by potluck.

## **Independent Study** 
Exceptionally qualified students entering their third- or fourth-year may take a program of independent study provided it has been approved by the Department or Departments principally involved.
A Department may approve an independent study program without permitting it to be counted toward a concentration in that Department. It is, consequently, the responsibility of students taking such programs to ensure that the concentration requirements for their degree will be met.
Requests for such a program must be received one month before the start of the first term in which the student intends to undertake the program. Requests must include:
1. a detailed outline of the project, including its aims, the topics to be studied, and a preliminary list of readings;
2. the names of the faculty members supervising the project, including the principal coordinator;
3. the number of units for which the project is to substitute, based on an estimate of the amount of work to be covered by the project, taking into account the planned learning hours; and
4. the method by which the student’s performance is to be evaluated, and the method by which the grade or grades will be assigned.
Course numbers assigned to independent study are specified under Course Numbers in the [Introduction](https://www.queensu.ca/academic-calendar/arts-science/introduction/) section of the _Calendar_. The departmental code assigned to the course will be that of the department, which is closest to the material studied, provided it has agreed to take academic responsibility for the project.
## Language Courses
Credit will be allowed for successful completion of courses in languages other than English and other than those offered at Queen’s provided that:
1. The course is in a modern language, defined as one that is currently used by an existing culture;
2. The course is offered by an accredited university, a school affiliated with such a university or by one of the language schools historically recognized by Queen’s;
3. Criteria for determining credit equivalency will be by parameters currently in use for all courses, that is, a grade determined by the host institution, number of contact hours, learning objectives/outcomes, type and number of assignments; and
4. The student has the course approved prior to departure by means of an International Letter of Permission and supplies appropriate evidence of the above on return.
Credit for such language courses will transfer as [LANG 101](https://www.queensu.ca/academic-calendar/search/?P=LANG%20101 "LANG 101")/3.0, for a first course in a modern language, [LANG 102](https://www.queensu.ca/academic-calendar/search/?P=LANG%20102 "LANG 102")/3.0 for a continuation of [LANG 101](https://www.queensu.ca/academic-calendar/search/?P=LANG%20101 "LANG 101")/3.0, [LANG 201](https://www.queensu.ca/academic-calendar/search/?P=LANG%20201 "LANG 201")/3.0, for an advanced-level course in a modern language and [LANG 202](https://www.queensu.ca/academic-calendar/search/?P=LANG%20202 "LANG 202")/3.0 for a continuation of [LANG 201](https://www.queensu.ca/academic-calendar/search/?P=LANG%20201 "LANG 201")/3.0.

1. Undergraduate
2. Undergraduate Program Information
First year students take our leading edge course Introduction to Sociology (SOCY122). This course introduces students to the core ideas and themes in contemporary Sociology, using a variety of teaching and learning methods that combine dynamic lectures and small group tutorials. Students learn the basics of Sociology, the latest ideas and approaches to _thinking sociologically_, and explore the breadth of the discipline, but we also train them in university level writing, argumentation and research skills.        
After taking Introduction to Sociology in their first year, students take core training courses in sociological theory and research methods in their second year, alongside a wide array of optional courses. In their third and fourth years, students choose increasingly specialized option courses. Third year students also have many opportunities to study Sociology abroad through the International Programs Office. Fourth year courses are seminars with a maximum of 25 students, enabling an excellent faculty to student ratio. Fourth year students may also opt to work with a professor on a thesis project over two terms on a specialized topic. 
The courses in the undergraduate program cover a wide range of topics such as - Race and Racialization; Globalization; Consumer Culture; Digital Sociology; Deviance and Social Control; Policing; Criminal Justice; Professions; Health, Illness and Disability; Law and Social Structure; Gender and Contemporary Society; Science, Knowledge, and Power; Digital Capitalism; Love, Sex, and Sociology - allowing students to sample the field very broadly or concentrate some of their interests in our three core research areas:

# [Professional Development at Queen’s: How it Works](https://www.queensu.ca/grad-postdoc/professional-development/about) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/grad-postdoc/professional-development/about_

## An Integrated Skills-based Framework for Your Academic, Professional, and Personal Success
Our mission at the SGSPA is to enable graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to develop the capacities needed to lead us collectively into a better future. Learning at Queen’s is inspired by an inclusive and collaborative community that balances wellbeing, academic excellence, and professional growth.
Using an integrated skills-based framework, our programming builds on knowledge and applied skills already learned to explore additional competencies to prepare for future careers, whether in academic or non-academic fields.
Our professional and academic development opportunities provide graduate students and postdoctoral fellows with diverse learning opportunities to cultivate a range of personal, professional, and academic skills to achieve continued success as globally engaged citizens.
The SGSPA, in collaboration with various Queen’s and external partners, offers a suite of skill-building workshops and opportunities. Using a holistic approach our framework consists of four key sectors: “Community” is our uniting theme, with the intersecting pillars of “Academic,” “Wellbeing,” and “Professional.”
To address each sector, we offer a range of activities – modules, workshops or events – for students and postdocs to choose from throughout their time at Queen’s. The diversity of our offerings allows you to select which areas and competencies you wish to strengthen, while also reflecting on what you have learned.
In consultation with our partners, an annual calendar of activities will be provided and tagged according to both the sector, the type of activity and who will be hosting the activity.
## Opportunities for Professional Development
As part of your development, you can access and participate in various professional development programs and events, which are all available on our [searchable calendar](https://www.queensu.ca/grad-postdoc/professional-development/workshops-events "Workshops & Events"). These include:
* [Workshops & Opportunities](https://www.queensu.ca/grad-postdoc/professional-development/workshops-opportunities)

## Queen’s Professional Development Record
All students and postdoctoral fellows who participate in SGSPA approved workshops or activities, will receive a Queen's Graduate Professional Development Record (formally called the "Supplemental Training Record") on completion of their degree, or fellowship. This record will:
* Provide a record of all SGSPA approved workshops and activities, including the month/year you participated in that workshop/event/module/activity
* Allow you to download the record for yourself on completion of your degree
_Note: It is important that you set up your record by registering in the_ _and that you ensure you always use your full name and Queen's email when registering for activities. If you don't, it will be difficult for us to match your activities with your record._
## Accessibility
Queen’s is committed to an inclusive campus community with accessible goods, services, and facilities that respect the dignity and independence of persons with disabilities. The School of Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs professional development workshop series is available in an accessible format or with appropriate communication supports upon request.

# [Records Management and Privacy Office](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/faqs) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/faqs_

#### What is FIPPA?
FIPPA is the _Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act_. Its purpose is to make public bodies more accountable and to protect personal privacy. The purposes of the Act are achieved by:
* Giving the public a right of access to University records
* Giving individuals a right of access to personal information about them
* Giving individuals a right to request the correction of personal information about them
* Ensuring appropriate collection, use and disclosure of personal information
* Providing an independent review of decisions made under the Act
#### What can people access under the Act?
Any "record" in the custody or under the control of the University
This does NOT include records excluded from the scope of the Act:
* Proposed or conducted research
* Teaching materials
* Employment or labour relation matters
* Private donations to the University Archives
* * *
#### What is a record?
* Any piece of recorded information, however it is recorded (printed, electronic, on film, etc.)
* Your personal emails or voicemails are not University records; however, emails or voicemails (if saved) relating to university matters **are** University records and subject to the Act
* * *
#### Are there any restrictions on what people can access? 
There are certain mandatory and discretionary exemptions that govern the University’s response to an access request. They include, but are not limited to:
* Solicitor-client records
* Records harmful to the University’s economic interests
* Records containing third party information
* Records containing a third party’s personal information
* Records that pose a danger to health and safety
* Records that relate to law enforcement
* Records that are already publicly available or will be available in 90 days
#### What do I do if I receive a request for access to records?
* Generally, you should continue to share information that you have normally shared
* If you receive a request for information that you would not normally share or that you think might be covered under the exemptions, then you should refer the requester to the [FIPPA Contact](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/contact-us/fippa-list "FIPPA Contact List") for your faculty, school, or department, or contact the Privacy Officer by email at [access.privacy@queensu.ca](mailto:access.privacy@queensu.ca).
* * *
#### How are these referred or formal requests handled?
These requests are handled by the Office of the Privacy Officer. The requester has to pay a $5.00 application fee and may be required to pay for search time to locate the record, for time taken to prepare the record for disclosure, and for other costs such as photocopying.
* * *
#### Can someone ask for my research material under the Act?
No, records relating to proposed or conducted research are not covered by the Act. However, the Act does require disclosure of the subject matter and amount of funding received with respect to the research.
* * *
#### Can someone ask for my professional records created as part of my consulting work?
No. These records are not University records and are not covered by the Act.
* * *
#### Can I give the family of a deceased employee access to the employee’s email and other records?
The [Access Authorization Procedure](https://www.queensu.ca/its/policies/access-authorization-procedure) sets out who can grant access to a deceased employee’s records and accounts. In all cases, access must be provided in accordance with FIPPA. FIPPA permits an individual’s personal representative (or executor) to have full access to the individual’s records and accounts for the purposes of administering the individual’s estate. Given the amount of personal information likely to be in the records—both of the deceased individual and other people—it is important to see proof that the individual making the request is, indeed, the executor.
If the individual making the request is not the executor, then FIPPA permits the disclosure of personal information about a deceased individual to the spouse or a close relative of the deceased individual for compassionate reasons. Note that in this case, only the personal information of the deceased individual may be disclosed. Accordingly, the university would be required to review the documentation carefully to prevent disclosure of information pertaining to other individuals, and information that may be confidential or proprietary information of the university.
#### What personal privacy rights are in the Act?
* The University must provide the purpose and legal authority for collecting personal information
* The University must collect personal information directly from the person whom it concerns
* The University must make an effort to ensure that the personal information it uses is accurate and complete
* The University must ensure the security of collection, access, use, disclosure, and disposal of personal information
* The University may only use personal information only for the purpose for which it was collected or for a consistent purpose
* The University may disclose personal information for the purpose for which it was collected or a consistent purpose or in other specific circumstances, including:
 * upon receipt of written consent
 * to comply with other legislation that allows disclosure
 * to comply with a judicial order
 * to allow a University employee to perform his/her duties
 * to a law enforcement agency under certain conditions
 * if there are compelling circumstances affecting anyone's health and safety or in compassionate circumstances
* * *
#### What is personal information?
Personal information is recorded information about an identifiable individual including but not limited to:
* Race, national or ethnic origin, colour
* Religion, age, gender, or sexual orientation
* Marital or family status
* Information about educational, criminal, psychiatric, or employment history
* Any identifying number or symbol
* The individual’s address, telephone number, fingerprints or blood type
#### I usually ask students to provide me with some personal information; can I still collect this information?
Yes. You can collect personal information from students as long as you provide “notice” of the collection. The notice must contain:
* The legal authority for the collection of personal information
* The purpose for the collection
* The title, address and phone number of a contact person
A typical notice statement might look like this: _The personal information on this form is collected under the authority of the Queen’s University Royal Charter of 1841, as amended. This information will be used to contact you regarding class related assignments. If you have any questions please contact \[your name\] at \[telephone number\] or \[email\]._
You may give notice orally in class if you so choose. Don't collect more personal information than you need for the purpose at hand.
* * *
#### Can I have access to a student's academic transcript?
* Only if it is necessary to fulfill a specific job duty. For example, faculty who serve on appeals panels or who are charged with academic advising may ask administrators to provide them with a copy of transcripts for that purpose.
* Due to the limitations of the student data information system you cannot access transcripts from your own computer.
* * *
#### Can I share information about my students with other faculty?
You should refrain from sharing personal information about your students with other faculty without the student’s consent.
* * *
#### **Can I act as a referee for students?**
Yes. You should ask the student to provide you with written consent and you should keep it on file. Please use the [Academic Reference Request Form](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/sites/oapwww/files/uploaded_files/Academic%20Reference%20Request%20Form.pdf).
#### If marks are assigned for attendance or participation, can I still take attendance?
You can still take attendance. You can take attendance verbally, or if the class is too large you can pass around a blank sheet and ask students to print their name on the sheet. Avoid passing around a list of student names and student numbers provided by the faculty administration.
* * *
#### Can I leave student assignments or exams outside my office for students to pick up?
Student grades are personal information and the University needs to take reasonable precautions to prevent unauthorized access. Consider using Moodle, returning assignments in class or during office hours, or having administrative staff supervise the return of assignments. Whatever solution you choose, avoid writing the student's grade on the outside of the assignment or exam where it can be easily seen by others.
* * *
#### Can I post student grades?
Posting of student grades is strongly discouraged. If you must post grades, the student's name and the first four digits of the student number should be stripped from the list of marks. The marks should then be sorted and presented in numeric sequence using the last four digits of the student number. If despite this attempt to conceal identity, it is still possible to identify a student (e.g. where there are extreme outliers in the data or the class is very small) grades should not be posted.
#### What should be my practice when I use email to correspond with other faculty or administrators?
Email is not a secure medium and is not appropriate for transmitting sensitive personal information. If you must use email to transmit personal information, attach a password-protected document. See the video on [encrypting email attachments](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/node/75).
#### How do I know if something is a record?
A record is official recorded information, regardless of medium or characteristics, created, received, or maintained by a Queen’s University office, unit, or Faculty. [University Records](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/administration-and-operations/records-management-policy) document decisions, actions, policies, and procedures; serve as legal evidence; provide an audit trail; provide for accountability; or document institutional memory. [Non-University Records](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/administration-and-operations/records-management-policy) are records created or received as a result of personal activities and often include such items as research and study notes, teaching materials, publications and personal communications of individual faculty, staff and students. When in doubt contact the [Queen’s Records Manager](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/node/14) for assistance when determining if a document your unit is holding is a University Record or not.
* * *
#### When can I dispose of a record?
Records may only be disposed of when they have met their minimum required retention period. The Queen's University [Directory of Records](http://records-retention.library.queensu.ca/directory-records.php) provides a listing of the types—or series--of records held by the University. Each records series will have its own retention trigger, retention period, and final disposition. Review the [Directory of Records](http://records-retention.library.queensu.ca/directory-records.php) to determine when the records you are reviewing are eligible for final disposition. Please note that if your office is **not** the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR), you may be eligible to dispose of records at your convenience. Contact the [Queen’s Records Manager](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/node/14) to determine if your office is the OPR for records you are reviewing.
* * *
#### Paper or digital records, is there a difference?
Records are frequently sheets of paper, but may also be ledgers, databases, word processing documents, or any number of other formats. The **content** of a record is the most important factor; the medium that the content is recorded on is usually of far less significance. If you plan to scan hardcopy documents, ensure the digital document is a suitable replacement before you dispose of the paper original. Contact the [Queen’s Records Manager](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/node/14) if you would like assistance before starting a scanning project. See also the [Fact Sheet on Scanning University Records](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/node/80).
* * *
#### Is email a record?
Email can be a record if it documents decisions, actions, policies, and procedures; serves as legal evidence; provides an audit trail; provides for accountability; or documents institutional memory. Many email messages are [transitory](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/node/85) and don’t need to be retained. Often, the record of importance is an attachment to an email message, rather than the message itself. However, email is often used as a record and should be managed accordingly. See the [Fact Sheet on Using and Managing Email](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/node/86).
* * *
#### How long do I need to keep email?
The retention of email is based on the type of email it is. [Transitory](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/node/85) messages may be deleted as soon as they no longer serve a business purpose. **Reference** messages may be deleted when they are no longer required for reference purposes. Messages that are **Records** should be retained based on the appropriate [Records Retention Schedule](https://archives.queensu.ca/records-retention-schedules). Note that any communication that contains an individual’s personal information (such as an email exchange between a student and an employee) must be retained for a minimum of one year based on the _Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act._
* * *
#### Do I need to keep every record I create or receive in the course of my work?
No, many records are [transitory](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/node/85) and can be disposed of when no longer of use. Notes taken as an _aide-memoire_, drafts of documents that have been superseded by later drafts or the final document, audio recordings once transcribed, and similar types of records can be destroyed as transitory. If you have received a record from another office as a courtesy copy or simply for your information, it is likely the sending office has primary responsibility of retaining the **authoritative copy** of the record and you can dispose of your copy. Lastly, if a record has met or exceeded its minimum retention period, it should be disposed of in accordance with the [Records Retention Schedule](https://archives.queensu.ca/records-retention-schedules). Retaining records past their identified retention period exposes the university to greater risk and increased costs.
#### Is there a preferred tool for recording online classes and meetings?
While a variety of tools exist to facilitate remote learning and meetings, **Microsoft Teams** and **Zoom** have been authorized for use by Queen’s and are therefore the recommended tools for virtual classes and meetings. Be sure you are using the **enterprise versions** provided and supported by [Queen’s ITS](https://www.queensu.ca/its/).
Make certain you are familiar with the features of your preferred tool, either **Teams** or **Zoom**, including how to enable security and privacy safeguards. 
* * *
#### What privacy issues do I need to be aware of when making a recording?
When recording a virtual session, you should maintain an awareness of the confidentiality of those meetings, classes, or events. Consider whether it is possible for others in your home or remote workplace to overhear confidential conversations.
Be mindful that while many devices allow for enabling video, some individuals may prefer to participate using voice only, or to obscure the background of their meeting space.
Making video or audio recordings of meetings, classes, or events should only be done if there is a compelling reason to do so. Recordings are records and require proper management and storage. Remember that a recording may become subject to an access to information request.
See also the Fact Sheets on [Working Remotely](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/guidance/fact-sheets/working-remotely "Working Remotely") and [Privacy and Remote Teaching and Learning](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/guidance/privacy-and-remote-teaching-and-learning "Privacy and Remote Teaching and Learning").
* * *
#### What should I consider when deciding whether to record and post synchronous sessions?
If a session is primarily lecture (i.e. very little student speaking), then student privacy can be maintained by setting the instructor’s **Zoom** to **active speaker mode**. If some students will be speaking and there is a concern about capturing that audio, in **Zoom** the session can be set to record all speakers to separate audio files. The instructor can then post the video recording, and the audio recording only of themselves speaking. (Note that since no student voices are saved the instructor should repeat any student questions being asked before providing an answer).
If the session requires student participation and discussion for grading purposes then generally it is recommended that a session should not be recorded.
If the session is an interactive session (e.g. tutorial) where an instructor or TA is working through problems and asking questions, and it is important to provide a recording for the benefit of any students who are unable to attend the live session, then students should be allowed to keep their cameras off. The instructor should keep **Zoom** in **active speaker mode** while recording to avoid inadvertently capturing student video.
* * *
#### Am I allowed to make a recording without the consent of the other attendees?
For most situations involving employees, express consent is not required, but it is considered best practice and a professional courtesy to ensure all attendees are aware that you intend to record the session and for what purpose. You may announce your intention to record prior to the meeting in the meeting invitation, or immediately after the meeting has begun.
When **students** are being recorded, FIPPA requires that we provide notice that we are collecting their personal information. Include a notice of recording in the course syllabus, through the Learning Management System (e.g., onQ), on a course website, or by other reasonable means. See the Fact Sheet on [Privacy and Remote Teaching and Learning](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/node/124) for a sample notice.
**Express consent is required** where teleconferencing or video conferencing is used to facilitate **student advising** or other kinds of **medical or counselling activities. Consent must be documented.** Documentation can include a purpose created form, an email reply, or even in-video oral consent.
Both **Teams** and **Zoom** alert attendees that a recording is taking place once the “Record” option has been selected. Additionally, **Zoom** can ask participants for consent when a recording starts if the **Recording Disclaimer** has been enabled in the Recording tab under the **Settings** menu on the **Zoom** website.
* * *
#### Can I stop attendees from making a recording using the video conferencing tool?
Yes. If you set the meeting options before the meeting occurs, you can determine who will have the ability to use a variety of functions including starting or stopping recording. Organizers can do this by default; you can also designate specific individuals to act as presenters who will also have access to various functions including recording.
In **Teams,** if you do not limit the **Who can present?** permission to Organizers (**Only me**), or Presenters (**Specific people**), then all attendees (**Everyone**) will have access to the recording functions.
In **Zoom**, you need to access your Zoom account via the Zoom website. The **Recording** tab under the **Settings** menu will allow you to set the **Local Recording** option to enable or disable “**Allow hosts and participants to record the meeting to a local file**” by toggling a slider. Attendees may also request and be granted approval to record if they do not begin the meeting with that permission.
* * *
#### Where is my video stored once the recording is stopped?
By default, recordings made using **Teams** are processed and accessible in the **Microsoft Stream** app. In Stream you can manage and share your recording. You will receive an email notification when your recording is ready to be managed.
**Zoom** meetings can recorded either to cloud-based Zoom servers, accessed via your Zoom web account, or locally on your device. You will receive an email notification when your recording is ready to be managed if you saved the file to the cloud. The local storage location can be defined by the user or else it will appear by default in a folder named **Zoom** in the **Documents** folder of your profile.
* * *
#### How long are my recordings retained?
Recordings made by **Teams** are retained by **Stream indefinitely**. It is up to the owner(s) of the recording to delete the recording when it is no longer required. Deleted recordings in the **Teams** environment persist in the recycle bin and will only be permanently deleted after 30 days unless the owner manually empties their recycle bin.
Recordings made using **Zoom’s** cloud save option will only be accessible for **30 days** before the recording expires. To retain a recording for longer than 30 days it must be downloaded and preserved via other means. Locally saved recordings will persist until the user deletes them.
Note that recordings containing the personal information of a student (e.g., name, image) must be retained for a **minimum of _one year_** after use in accordance with [FIPPA s. 40 (1)](https://www.ontario.ca/document/freedom-information-and-protection-privacy-manual/chapter-7-privacy-fundamentals#section-11).
The disposal of University records should be documented using the [University records destruction process](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/records-management/university-records/dispose "Dispose of Records"). Documenting the disposal of records is required by FIPPA for records such as recordings of students which contain personal information. It is not necessary to document disposal of transitory records, such as a recording of a meeting taken as an aide-memoire for the purpose of preparing minutes.
* * *
#### When should I use the attendance function?
Both **Teams** and **Zoom** have the ability for the meeting organizer to access and export attendance data. If this information is beneficial to the organizer, such as tracking student attendance in a course or recording employee attendance at a meeting, it is reasonable for this data to be exported. Whenever attendance data is exported it becomes a record and must be retained and disposed of appropriately. If there is no need for attendance do not export attendance reports.

# [Acronyms and abbreviations | Accessibility Hub](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/across-campus/web-standards-and-accessibility-development-guide/writing-web/acronyms-and) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/across-campus/web-standards-and-accessibility-development-guide/writing-web/acronyms-and_

## Accessibility Recommendations
In general, screen readers do not recognize abbreviations and acronyms, and generally read them as if they were typical English words. For instance the acronym "ITS" would not be read by screen readers as the intended "_I.T.S._", but as "_It's_". To assist with accessibility we suggest:
1. Using periods between letters (e.g. I.T.S. versus ITS) in an acronym may help screen readers parse the acronym.
 
2. When writing an acronym in an ALT tag, add spaces between characters (e.g. <alt="I T S" >).
 
## Other Guidelines
Never assume that the end reader knows what the acronym or abbreviation stands for. Even common terms (like "M.B.A." for instance) should be clearly defined when first introduced (see example below). Also consider that an acronym or abbreviation in one sphere may not mean the same in another (eg. "C.A.S." has been used for both the Children's Aid Society and the Canadian AIDS Society).
When the term is used within a collection of web pages, it must be fully defined on each page in the collection, as users potentially will not start at "page 1" (due to search-engine results, deep linking , etc.).
While there are programmatic techniques that can encode expanded definitions of acronyms and abbreviations, each initial introduction of an acronym or abbreviation must first be written in full in the page content, followed by its shortened form in brackets. Subsequent use of the acronym or abbreviation on that page need not be defined. For example:
"Canadians looking to propel their careers into the international business arena can now earn an Ivy League Masters of Business Administration (M.B.A.) in 17 months while they continue to work in Canada with the new Queen's-Cornell International Executive M.B.A."

1. Active Learning
2. Active Learning Classrooms
When students are engaging in active learning, they are constructing meaning and taking responsibility for their learning. Rather than being a passive recipient of information, the active learner puts knowledge to use. Words capturing an active approach to learning include action verbs such as analyze, evaluate, generate, apply, connect, and extend. These actions engage students to think at a higher level, taking learning beyond memorization and recall towards active thinking, doing, and engagement.
Because approaches to teaching, technology and space design can have a profound effect on student learning, the Queen's active learning classrooms have been intentionally designed, built and equipped to accommodate a different numbers of students in different configurations and with different technologies. By enabling a range of uses, we will have the opportunity to assess a variety of approaches to student engagement.
For those that wish to learn more about integrating active learning strategies into your teaching practice, the Centre for Teaching and Learning (CTL) offers research and resources on [Active Learning](https://www.queensu.ca/ctl/resources/instructional-strategies/active-learning) and a guidebook with sample strategies that [Focus on Active Learning: Active Learning Strategies (PDF, 599KB)](https://www.queensu.ca/ctl/sites/ctlwww/files/uploaded_files/Resources/Instructional%20Strategies/Focus%20on%20Active%20Learning%20Guide%202013%20-%202014.pdf). If you have questions or would like to discuss your ideas for course design and use of the active learning classrooms space with an Educational Developer, please contact the CTL at [ctl@queensu.ca](mailto:ctl@queensu.ca?subject=Active%20Learning%20Classroom%20Consult).

### Boundaries, Membership & Belonging
[Will Kymlicka](https://www.queensu.ca/philosophy/people/will-kymlicka "Kymlicka, Will"), Professor and Canada's Research Chair in Political Philosophy at Queen's University, is co-director, with Irene Bloemraad (sociology, UC Berkeley), of a new multi-year program on [Boundaries, Membership and Belonging](https://www.cifar.ca/research/program/boundaries-membership-belonging), funded by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. The program brings together leading social scientists and political and legal theorists from around the world to explore how the boundaries of social and political membership are drawn in the contemporary world, and whether we can re-draw these boundaries in a way that is more inclusive without losing solidarity and the possibility of collective action. All societies distinguish members from non-members. Indeed, evolutionary biology and psychology suggest that humans are predisposed to distinguish “us” from “them,” and the process can lead to increased trust and cooperation towards members. But it can also lead to prejudice, suspicion and injustice towards non-members. The Boundaries, Membership & Belonging program brings together normative theorists and empirical social scientists to make sense of membership politics, particularly at the national level: to explore how claims to national membership are made and contested, how the circle of national membership expands and contracts over time, how ideas of national belonging are mobilized, and how feelings of national membership relate to more universalist or cosmopolitan identities and claims. In short: why membership matters in a globalizing world.

### The Multiculturalism Policy Index
[Will Kymlicka](https://www.queensu.ca/philosophy/people/will-kymlicka "Kymlicka, Will"), Professor and Canada's Research Chair in Political Philosophy at Queen's University, is co-director, along with [Keith Banting](https://www.queensu.ca/politics/people/faculty/keith-banting) (Political Studies & School of Policy Studies, Queen’s), of the [Multiculturalism Policy Index](https://www.queensu.ca/mcp/) project, which monitors the evolution of multiculturalism policies across 21 Western democracies. The MCP Index project is designed to provide information about multiculturalism policies in a standardized format that aids comparative research and contributes to the understanding of state-minority relations. The project provides an index for each of three types of minorities: one index relating to immigrant groups, one relating to historic national minorities, and one relating to indigenous peoples. The MCP Index for immigrant minorities is now available on annual basis, with scores for each MCP policy in each country from 1960 to 2020. The data identifies the precise year in which a country adopted and/or retrenched any particular MCP, and includes early developments in countries such as Canada and Australia which introduced MCPs prior to 1980.The Multiculturalism Policy Index and supporting documentation are freely available for researchers, public officials, journalists, students, activists, and others interested in the topic.

### Toppling Monuments: Colonial Trauma, Justice, Heritage, and Restorative Healing
[Christine Sypnowich](https://www.queensu.ca/philosophy/people/christine-sypnowich "Sypnowich, Christine"), Professor and Head of the Department of Philosophy, is the leader of the interdisciplinary project, “Toppling Monuments: Colonial Trauma, Justice, Heritage, and Restorative Healing”, funded by both the [New Frontiers in Research Fund (NFRF)](https://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/funding-financement/nfrf-fnfr/index-eng.aspx) and a [Wicked Ideas](https://www.queensu.ca/vpr/funding/internal/wicked-ideas) grant. Debate rages as Kingston struggles with the legacy of its most famous former resident, Sir John A. Macdonald, and his actions against Indigenous peoples whose lands and children were taken. Like communities worldwide, the city is at a historic juncture confronting cultural narratives of racism and dispossession. An interdisciplinary team, led by Sypnowich, will examine Kingston as a case study to address the social exclusion and historical trauma inherent in current understandings of heritage. Uniting conceptual investigation, health care practice, and cultural resurgence, the team of Indigenous and settler scholars will consider how community-based art practices can contribute to an inclusive heritage and enable restorative healing for Indigenous and racialized people. The project’s collaborators include Philosophy’s [Will Kymlicka](https://www.queensu.ca/philosophy/people/will-kymlicka "Kymlicka, Will"), [Dolleen Tisawii’ashii Manning](https://www.queensu.ca/philosophy/people/dolleen-tisawiiashii-manning "Manning, Dolleen Tisawii’ashii"), [Margaret Moore](https://www.queensu.ca/philosophy/people/margaret-moore "Moore, Margaret"), [Jean Thomas](https://www.queensu.ca/philosophy/people/jean-thomas "Thomas, Jean"), and [Grégoire Webber](https://www.queensu.ca/philosophy/people/gregoire-webber "Webber, Grégoire"), as well as leading researchers in health sciences and medicine.

### The Kantian Rationality Lab
[David Bakhurst](https://www.queensu.ca/philosophy/people/david-bakhurst "Bakhurst, David"), George Whalley Distinguished University Professor John and Ella G. Charlton Professor of Philosophy at Queen’s University, is one of five ‘Key Researchers’ for the Kantian Rationality Lab, part of the Akademia Kantiana of the Baltic Federal University in Kaliningrad. ‘Reason’ or ‘rationality’ is the overarching concept of Kant’s philosophy. It shapes and pervades his theoretical as well as his practical philosophy, informing his understanding of the sciences as well as our ethical life. It is a complex and controversial concept that continues to inform philosophical discussions today. At the same time, it is a concept that has numerous aspects and applications that have yet to be explained and explored, tested and tried, revised and refined. This is what the Kantian Rationality Lab aims to do. The Lab is the recipient of a substantial grant from the Russian Foundation for the Humanities.

### What We Owe to Future Generations
[Rahul Kumar](https://www.queensu.ca/philosophy/people/rahul-kumar "Kumar, Rahul"), Professor of Philosophy at Queen’s University, has been awarded a SSHRC Insight Grant to pursue his project, "What We Owe to Future Generations". The project will examine questions about the foundations and content of our obligations to future generations. It will advance an understanding of these obligations as interpersonal, or relational, obligations that are owed to other people. It will, in particular, focus on the implications of this way of thinking on both how we ought to reason about obligations to mitigate the effects of climate change and about what, in substance, we are required to do. Questions to be considered include whether the fact that some of the most serious effects of climate change will be felt by those who will live many, many generations from now justifies discounting the badness of those effects in moral reasoning, how tail-end risks of human extinction as a result of climate change ought to be taken into account, how to reason about the balance between climate-related obligations and other obligations to living individuals, and whether climate-related obligations demand sacrifices of us that are unreasonably demanding.

### Duties, Constraints, Prerogatives, and Permissions: Or, How to Defend Lesser-Evil Options
[Kerah Gordon-Solmon](https://www.queensu.ca/philosophy/people/kerah-gordon-solmon "Gordon-Solmon, Kerah"), Associate Professor of Philosophy at Queen’s University, has been awarded a SSHRC Insight Grant to pursue her project, "Duties, Constraints, Prerogatives, and Permissions: Or, How to Defend Lesser-Evil Options". Promoting the good, exercising prerogatives, and complying with constraints are basic elements of our ethical lives. And yet, adjudicating among them to figure out what we are permitted, or obligated, to do when they steer us in different directions is a notoriously difficult task. Reconciling a plausible account of each within a unified theory is an even greater challenge. The aim of Gordon-Solmon’s project is to make advances toward the latter via pursuit of the former. In particular, Gordon-Solmon proposes to make a case-study of how we ought to adjudicate between our presumptive duties to promote the good, and our presumptive duties to comply with constraints, in the context of lesser-evils cases. These are cases in which we are justified in contravening a constraint (i.e., against harming the innocent) by the great good we will achieve, or the great evil we will prevent, in doing so. In these cases, agents are generally believed to have two permissible options. We may inflict the harm to promote the greater good, or we may comply with the constraint against harming, thereby allowing the greater evil to eventuate. Despite – or, perhaps, because of – its widespread acceptance, this belief is seldom defended. Gordon-Solmon aims to fill this lacuna.

### Epistemic Corruption
[Sergio Sismondo](https://www.queensu.ca/philosophy/people/sergio-sismondo "Sismondo, Sergio"), Professor of Philosophy, and [Daryn Lehoux](https://www.queensu.ca/philosophy/people/daryn-lehoux "Lehoux, Daryn"), Professor of Classics and Philosophy, have won a SSHRC Insight Grant for their project, "[Epistemic Corruption](https://www.epistemiccorruption.com/)" – one of the largest such grants at Queen’s in 2022. They will use it to bring together a dozen collaborators from a variety of fields to develop models of the corruption of knowledge systems.
In recent years, many people have loudly announced a crisis of authority, provoked especially by the spread of low-quality information, disinformation and distractions. Well-known cases include: manufactured ignorance about climate change, in which real and constructed doubts were amplified to challenge scientific certainty; some groups’ latching onto unproven remedies for Covid-19; general concerns about trust in both traditional and new sources of information, from newspapers and television to social media. This crisis, if there is one, is closely connected to concerns about the corruption of knowledge systems, or “epistemic corruption”.
Lehoux, Sismondo and their collaborators will be asking questions such as: What can it mean for a system of knowledge production or dissemination to be called corrupt? How does a system appear to become corrupted, and by what kinds of actors and processes? What are typical competing claims about the integrity of a system?

### 'Atmospheric Agency' and Ethical Responses to Climate Change
[Mick Smith](https://www.queensu.ca/philosophy/people/mick-smith "Smith, Mick"), Professor of Philosophy jointly appointed with Environmental Studies, has been awarded a SSHRC Insight Grant to pursue his project, ''Atmospheric Agency' and Ethical Responses to Climate Change'. Climate change is literally ‘world-changing’, but although philosophical approaches identify key moral issues, most frame problems and solutions within humanist paradigms that incorporate assumptions about human agency, autonomy, and exceptionalism that are actually deeply implicated in producing the societal forms responsible for the current crisis. For example, from this perspective the very idea of the _Anthropocene_, now widely adopted to designate these epochal climatic and ecological shifts, is misplaced. _Rather than entering a new anthropogenic epoch, we might more accurately be regarded as beginning to suffer the consequences of the modern suppression of non-human agencies_. This project coalesces around a concept of ‘atmospheric agency’ developed across scales from place to planet as a way of articulating both sensitivities / responses to our immediate environs and ethical responses to climate change. What does it mean to take the materiality of atmospheric changes seriously in terms of their philosophical implications? How is it that experiential / phenomenological sensitivity to localized atmospheres does not carry over to global climatic changes? Might we suggest ways to link (phenomenal) experiences of atmospheric agency to evaluational / ethical responses that encourage different and better social and ecological outcomes at all scales?

### Abolitionist Dream-Mapping
[Lisa Guenther](https://www.queensu.ca/philosophy/people/lisa-guenther "Guenther, Lisa"), Queen’s National Scholar in Political Philosophy and Critical Prison Studies, is director of a research project on Abolitionist Dream-Mapping funded by a [Mitacs Accelerate Grant](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/projects/abolitionist-dream-mapping), in collaboration with Modern Fuel Artist-Run Centre. The project brings together twelve graduate students from disciplines such as Philosophy, Cultural Studies, and Gender Studies to recover and create decolonial abolitionist methods for dismantling carceral-colonial institutions and building freer, healthier, and more just communities. We repurpose the colonial instrument of the map as a creative tool for navigating oppressive structures and sketching concrete alternatives to the world that slavery and colonialism has built. We also activate our collective power to dream, not as an escapist fantasy but as a critical research method that moves beyond an analysis of what is wrong with the world to experiment with ways of making it better. Our research is guided by three central questions: How do maps, images, and other forms of creative story-telling contribute to the transdisciplinary work of decolonial abolition? How does abolitionist and decolonial dreaming re-animate colonial and carceral concepts such as consent and authorship? And how do artists and researchers practice abolitionist and decolonial ethics in their work?

## Overview
Religion plays a major role in shaping and influencing various cultures and historical and political movements around the world. Thus, understanding religious traditions and their impact on diverse modern issues is vital preparation for building a career in the global marketplace. Studying religion involves examining the history of religious traditions, comparing the ideas and values of different religious systems, and understanding the place and function of religion in society. Students of Religious Studies investigate why people are religious, where religion comes from, and how it should be defined and understood.

 _https://www.queensu.ca/psychology/undergraduate-program/participant-pool-information_

## Why should I participate in research?
### It's Educational
Research participation will give you first-hand experience with and insight into the inner workings of psychology studies and how data in psychology are generated. This is relevant both for the classes offering credit and upper-year ones. Research participation will also help you think critically about research you are reading about in the media. Finally, it is a great way to determine if you would like to be involved in research projects in other ways – just ask the researcher about opportunities to volunteer or do a special directed lab course (PSYC 299/570/575).
### You will receive bonus credit to your final mark
For every half hour of research participation completed, you can increase your final mark in PSYC100 by 0.5%, up to a maximum of 5% (depends on the course, so see your syllabus). Note though that a failing mark would not be changed to a passing mark.
### You make research possible
Without student participation, many important questions in psychology may be left unanswered. Many of the studies that you are reading about in your classes were conducted with students just like you. Who knows? Maybe the studies you choose to participate in will find their way into future textbooks.
You also make it possible for your fellow undergraduate and graduate students to complete their degrees, because without the help of students like you, many would not be able to gather the data they need for their theses and dissertations.
## Things you need to know
### Am I eligible to participate in research for course credit?
If you are a student in Psyc 100, you are eligible to sign up for studies and earn course credit. Students in most Psyc 200-level courses are also eligible. Please check your course syllabus.
### How do I sign up for studies?
The following link will take you to [**SONA**](https://queensu.sona-systems.com/), our online Participant Management Software where you can sign up for studies.
### What do I need so that I can sign up for studies on SONA?
1. To be in the Participant Pool, you have to be enrolled in a course offering extra credit for research participation
 
2. You will receive your SONA login information in an email around the 3rd week of classes. You must have your student number and SONA password to sign up for studies (Note: this password is NOT your Queen’s email account password). For more details on registration, go to 2:31 of the [SONA instructional video](http://youtu.be/_1OnT2ZU6QQ).
 
### What is the first and last date I can participate in research for credit?
You can start signing up as soon as you receive your login information. Some research studies are usually already posted the third week of the fall term and new ones are added throughout the year. The last day you can earn extra research credit is the last day of classes for each semester. This cut-off is necessary so that we can distribute the credit information to instructors in a timely manner.
### How will research participation affect my grade?
Your final mark will increase by 0.5% for every half hour of research participation you complete. For example, if your mark in a course is a 78%, but you completed two different hour-long studies, your final mark for the course will be a 80%. Thus the grade on your transcript will be an A- instead of a B+. Your instructor will list the amount of extra credits allowed in their course on the course syllabus. For PSYC 100, students can earn a maximum of 5% toward their final course grade. For participating PSYC 200-level courses, students can earn between 2%-5% depending on the course.
If you are enrolled in more than one eligible course, you can complete studies toward each course. However, the same credits cannot be applied to more than one course.
Note that if you are in the on-campus PSYC 100 course, there is a 2.5 credit cap for online studies. This means that of your total of 5 credits, only 2.5 of those credits can be from online studies. There is no cap for in-person studies.
Note that research credit cannot be used to improve a failing mark into a passing mark.
### What if I cannot make my research appointment?
We understand that unexpected events do occur, and you may be unable to attend the session you sign up for as a result of extenuating circumstances. Cancel your research appointment in SONA as soon as possible (no later than 3 hrs before the appointment time), so that another student can be recruited to fill your spot. Please contact the researcher via email if you need to cancel an appointment within 3 hours of the appointed time. An “excused no-show” is guaranteed if you contact researchers 3 or more hours in advance of your appointment.
### What if I miss my research appointment without first cancelling?
We understand that unexpected events do occur. You should contact the experimenter with a brief explanation. If further appointments are available, and you are able to reschedule, the no-show will be excused. If you are not able to reschedule, but there are clear extenuating circumstances, again the no-show will be excused.
### What is the penalty for missing an appointment?
There are no penalties for a missed appointment (either for a study or an alternative assignment). However, after two unexcused no-shows you will not be able to sign up for any more studies and alternative assignments until the end of the semester.
### I have reached the limit of two unexcused no-shows. Now what?
If you have reached the limit of two unexcused no-shows you will not be able to sign up for additional studies or alternative assignments until the end of the semester. If there were extenuating circumstances, please contact the researchers first. You can follow up with the Participant Pool coordinator at [participant.pool@queensu.ca](mailto:participant.pool@queensu.ca).
You will be automatically granted the ability to sign up for studies to earn research credit the following academic semester.
### What is prescreening?
Some research is designed with a particular population in mind, e.g., women, individuals in relationships, etc. Prescreening is a process that allows researchers to reach that population. As part of your SONA registration, you can complete four demographic questions. In addition, during the first week of the fall semester you will be emailed a link to a separate online prescreening questionnaire that contains more than just demographic questions. You can complete the SONA prescreening at any time (for more details, go to 8:45 on the video), but the larger prescreening questionnaire will be due by the end of the drop/add period. If you complete the prescreening questionnaire, you often become eligible for additional studies. The those researchers will contact you directly to find a time to participate. Please note that you will never have to sign up for the offered studies; completing the prescreening questionnaire simply gives you additional opportunities to complete your credits as you prefer (for more details on how to sign up for studies, go to 3:41 of the instructional video).
### What if I have a question about a study?
For details on individual studies, such as your eligibility or finding about the results, please contact the researcher in charge listed on SONA or in your letter of information.
### Who do I turn to if I have concerns about a study I participated in?
To report any ethical or procedural concerns regarding an experiment or the conduct of an experimenter, follow the instructions from the letter of information you have received (LOI). For the Queen’s University Health Sciences and Affiliated Teaching Hospitals Research Ethics Board (HSREB) call 1-844-535-2988 (Toll free in North America) or [clarkaf@queensu.ca](mailto:clarkaf@queensu.ca). For research conducted outside of North America use: 1-613-533-2988. For Queen’s General Research Ethics Board, please call 1-844-535- 2988 (Toll free in North America) or [chair.GREB@queensu.ca](mailto:chair.GREB@queensu.ca). Call 1-613-533-2988 if outside North America. Do NOT contact your course instructor(s); they are not involved in administering the studies.
### What if I don’t want to participate in research?
Participation in research is entirely voluntary. If you want to earn credit but don’t want to participate in studies, you have the option of completing an alternative assignment instead.
### What is an ‘alternative assignment’?
The “alternative assignment” is an alternative to research participation that offers similar learning benefits. For an alternative assignment, researchers either will offer a walk-through of their experiment (without collecting data from you), or they will have you read an article or blog post, listen to a short podcast, or watch a short video and then answer questions about it. For all on-campus students, alternative assignments are administered in the lab.
Although the length of studies will vary, the alternative assignment will take less time (approximately 30 minutes), so you will earn 0.5% for each alternative assignment that you complete.
### How do I sign up for an alternative assignment?
In order to complete an alternative assignment, log on to SONA and then click on ‘studies.’ When you select a study, scroll down to find the ‘Principal Investigator’. Right Click on the mailbox icon on the right side of the screen, and select ‘copy email address’ to copy the Principal Investigator’s email address. Send that PI an email requesting to complete an alternative assignment. To complete more than one alternative assignment, you have to contact different Principal Investigators. You can request to complete an alternative assignment anytime before the last week of classes. Please note that your course instructor is not involved in the administration of alternative assignments.
Each lab offers a single, unique alternative assignment. Thus, you may contact a PI only once per year.
### I am a distance student. Can I participate in studies and get extra credit for my online class?
Yes! Look for studies with (ONLINE) in the title. They do not require your physical presence on campus.
### I am a distance student. Can I complete alternative assignments?
Yes! Follow the directions under _**"How do I sign up for an alternative assignment?"**_ above. In your email to the PI, please specify that you are a distance student and that you need to complete the assignment on a computer. Please note that some assignments may not be feasibly completed via a computer, and thus PIs may direct you to other labs. However, there should be plenty of assignments for you to choose from.
## Other Questions
### Do any courses have restrictions?
Please see your syllabi.
### Why is there a limit on the number of unexcused no-shows that I can have?
The participant pool is set up as a learning opportunity for you, a training opportunity for advanced students, and a research resource. When you don’t show up for an appointment for a study or an alternative assignment, you miss a learning opportunity; however, this also disrupts the broader system. It prevents other students for being able to participate in your place and wastes the time and resources of student trainees and researchers. It also contributes to waste of public funds as most research is sponsored by federal funding agencies. These funds pay for equipment, supplies, and researcher salaries. To maintain the integrity of the system, there is a limit of two unexcused no-shows per semester.
If you are interested in participating in research outside of the framework of the Psychology Participant Pool, please contact individual labs or researchers. Notices are posted on billboards in Humphrey Hall.
### What if I forget my password?
Go to [**‘Forgot your password?’**](https://queensu.sona-systems.com/lost_password.aspx). You will be sent instructions on how to reset your password so you can log in to SONA.
### How do I stop the emails and calls I receive about studies?
If you find that the number of emails or calls that you receive excessive, you may opt to have your name removed from the pre-screen list where you provided your contact information. Please email [Dr. Lee Fabrigar](mailto:fabrigar@queensu.ca), at the Department of Psychology. Note that you still can sign up for studies listed on SONA.
### What types of studies are available to participate in?
A short description of each study is available on SONA. The studies represent many areas of psychology: social, cognitive, neuroscience, clinical, and developmental. They also employ a wide range of research methods and tools.
### Can I participate in a study more than once?
You can participate in a study only one time. Note, however, that some studies have more than one session.
### Can I apply the credit I receive for a study to all my courses?
No. You cannot get credit more than once for the same study, i.e., you cannot use the same credit toward more than one course.
### How do I check how much credit I’ve earned?
You will be able to get this information from the SONA dashboard. For more information, go to 3:53 of the SONA instructional video or [https://youtu.be/\_1OnT2ZU6QQ?t=3m53s](https://youtu.be/_1OnT2ZU6QQ?t=3m53s).
### What if I haven’t received credit for a study?
If you have participated in a study but haven’t received your credit, first contact the researcher in charge of the study (listed on SONA). If that does not resolve the problem, then contact [participant.pool@queensu.ca](mailto:participant.pool@queensu.ca) stating your name, student number, the name of the study, and the date you completed it.
### Can I sign up for ANY study on SONA?
No – some studies have restrictions, e.g., language background, not in a relationship, etc. It is important that you are mindful of these restrictions. They will be listed in the study description box in SONA. If you are unclear if you are eligible for a particular study, please contact the researcher.
### How do I prepare for a research study?
If there is anything special that a study requires, e.g., no sex in the last 24 hours, you will be informed by the researchers. Otherwise, no preparation is required. Researchers appreciate it if you arrive on time and are in good physical and cognitive condition to be engaged with them for the duration of the study.
### Am I supposed to receive something at the end of a study?
At the end of a study, you should be “debriefed.” Debriefing can be verbal, on the computer screen, or through a debriefing letter and it should help you make sense of the research experience you’ve had. In some cases researchers may explain in more detail the question they are working on, in others what the variables in the study are, or yet in other cases how the tools they use work. If something picked your interest or raised a question, don’t hesitate to ask. What you receive – or learn – is partly in your hands!
Debriefing is also ethically required when there was deception or the study presents emotional, psychological, or other risks to participants. These risks and deception should be fully explained to your satisfaction .
### Do I need to tell my instructor how many credits I’ve earned?
No. For half-year courses, we send the extra credit information to the instructors at the end of the term. For full-year courses, credits are sent at the end of the school year.
### Is there an appeal or a grievance procedure?
Yes. Ethical concerns about the research should be directed to the Queen’s Ethics Board that has reviewed the research, [**HSREB**](https://www.queensu.ca/vpr/ethics/hsreb) or [**GREB**](https://www.queensu.ca/urs/ethics/general-research-ethics-board-greb) (see your letter of information). Concerns about credits, no-shows, and other matters concerning the pool should be addressed to the Participant Pool Coordinator at [participant.pool@queensu.ca](mailto:participant.pool@queensu.ca). In the case of an unexcused no-show, if there were extenuating circumstances, please contact the researcher first.

## Sharing Your Personal Information
Personal information may be shared with and used by employees or agents of the university who need the information in the performance of their duties and where the disclosure is necessary and proper in the discharge of the university's functions. 
Personal information may be shared internally between units, faculties, and administration as needed to support regular university operations. 
Student personal information may be shared with the university’s third-party contracted agents who provide services related to the learning environment, including digital services, such as email and the MS Office suite of services, learning management systems, remote proctoring services, and others. In all such cases, the university remains responsible for the stewardship of student information.  
## How We Collect and Use Your Personal Information
We collect your contact information and programs of interest in order to provide you with information about Queen’s University of interest to you. 
Prospective students’ personal information may be collected at recruitment events, campus tours, open houses and through digital channels. 
For applicants, we collect information necessary for assessing your suitability to attend Queen’s University (e.g., grades, academic history), to register you in the event you accept an offer of admission, and to enable analysis of our processes for fairness and equity (e.g., demographic information). This information is collected as follows: 
* Undergraduate applications are normally received through the Ontario Universities’ Application Centre (OUAC) but may be submitted directly. 
 
* Applications for graduate studies are normally received through the School of Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs’ admissions application system. 
 
* Some professional programs have their own processes and application systems, such as Post-Graduate Medical Education and Law. 
 
In order that **applicants** can form expectations regarding the use and disclosure of their personal information, the following are some examples of the uses and disclosures of personal information which relate to the admissions function of the university: 
* Personal information collected in the application process may be shared with the Ontario Universities' Application Centre (OUAC) and/or with other universities and colleges across Canada in the event that any information provided to Queen's as part of the application process is determined by Queen's to be false, misleading, or otherwise deceptive, or written by a third party. 
 
* Applicant information may be shared with the relevant faculty(ies), school(s) or department(s) for the purpose of admission only.  
 
* Applicants may be contacted about admission opportunities other than those specifically identified by the applicant. 
 
* Applicants may be contacted to guide the improvement of the university's services and offerings. 
 
* The Ontario Universities' Application Centre (OUAC) and/or the university(ies) will use your gender and date of birth for identification and document matching, and for statistical purposes. This information does not form part of Queen's University’s admission decisions. 
 
Information collected from applicants will be transferred to a student record if the applicant is admitted to the university. 
In order that **current students** can form expectations regarding the use and disclosure of their personal information, the following are some examples of the uses and disclosures of personal information which relate to the execution of various functions of the university: 
* Registration records, educational history and supporting documents, including records of misconduct, may be used for the adjudication of admission, progression, and graduation with respect to various programs. Such information may be transmitted to other educational institutions and partners involved in the delivery of programs offered at, with, or through Queen’s, including, but not limited to, entities involved in the provision of joint degrees, programs, plans, practicums, exchanges, placements, co-op positions, and service-learning opportunities. 
 
* Personal information is used to create class lists, grade submission lists and other materials needed by employees of the university. While photographs of students are collected and intended primarily for inclusion on the university’s identification cards, they may be included in class lists and other documents. 
 
* Names of students and their contact information are collected by the university in order to operate both virtual and physical classroom environments. 
 
* By registering in courses, students acknowledge that their names may be divulged, both orally and in written form, to other members of the course during activities such as, but not limited to, taking attendance, assigning topics, organizing students for group work, assessing classroom participation, facilitating classroom discussion, working in online learning tools, and organizing tutorials. Students who are concerned about such disclosures should contact the course instructor to identify whether there are any possible alternatives to such disclosure. Units may use contact information for course and related purposes. 
 
* Personal information including accessibility and dietary requirements will be collected and used for providing residential accommodations. 
 
* Personal information, including name, birth date, address, email address, telephone number, student number, degree program, and academic plan, may be used by **Student Wellness Services** for the purpose of identifying and contacting students who access their services.

This information is available to the public and will be published by Queen's University.  
 
## How We Disclose Your Personal Information
A student’s parents or guardian do not have a right to access to the student’s information. Students wishing the university to release financial and/or academic information to an individual, including a parent, or to an agency external to the university must provide their consent in SOLUS. **Such authorization will be effective until the student cancels the authorization**. For instructions on how to assign authorizations, please visit the [SOLUS Help page](https://www.queensu.ca/registrar/resources/solus-help#release-personal-information).
Specified records or portions thereof may be provided where required by law, such as:
* to persons or agencies pursuant to a court order, summons, or subpoena directing the university to release information;
* in accordance with the requirements of duly constituted professional licensing and certification bodies; and
* in accordance with Section 42(1) of the [Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90f31#BK66).
Personal information may be disclosed to ministries and agencies of the Ontario Government and the Government of Canada as required by statute or regulation. This includes transfers to entities such as Statistics Canada and the Ministry of Colleges and Universities as described below.
Your personal information may also be shared with the following external organizations and groups:
Students become members of the Alma Mater Society (AMS) or the Society of Professional and Graduate Students (SGPS) when they pay student activity fees. Students may opt out of certain fees which denies them access to specific services/activities. The university may disclose students’ personal information to various student organizations, under an information-sharing agreement, in order to allow for their participation in elections and other operations. In particular, personal information—including name, student number, email address, degree program, and academic plan—is disclosed to and may be used by organizations such as the Alma Mater Society of Queen's University, the Arts and Science Undergraduate Society, the Engineering Society, the Commerce Society, and the Society of Graduate and Professional Students for purposes such as the following: identifying and contacting students to provide them with access to student society membership and information about affiliated or sponsored programs, services, and activities; for verification and validation of voters for society referenda and elections; for the administration of the non-academic discipline system; and for communicating with members about student society matters. 
Personal information of students may be provided by the university to the Health and Dental Plan carriers in accordance with the Memoranda of Agreement and Understanding between the carriers and the student societies, AMS and SGPS, and between the carrier and the Queen's University International Centre. AMS and SGPS administrators may also use birthdate, gender, and academic concentration data of dental and health plan participants. If you have any questions or require additional information, please contact the **AMS Commissioner of Internal Affairs** at 613.533.6000, extension 74815, or the **SGPS Administrator.** 
Statistics Canada is the national statistical agency. As such, Statistics Canada carries out hundreds of surveys each year on a wide range of matters, including education. 
It is essential to be able to follow students across time and institutions to understand, for example, the factors affecting enrolment demand at post-secondary institutions. The increased emphasis on accountability for public investment means that it is also important to understand 'outcomes'. In order to conduct such studies, Statistics Canada asks all colleges and universities to provide data on students and graduates. Institutions collect and provide to Statistics Canada student identification information (student's name, student ID number, Social Insurance Number), student contact information (address and telephone number), student demographic characteristics, enrolment information, previous education, and labour force activity.
The _**[Federal Statistics Act](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/S-19/index.html)**_ provides the legal authority for Statistics Canada to obtain access to personal information held by educational institutions. The information may be used only for statistical purposes, and the confidentiality provisions of the _**[Statistics Act](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/S-19/index.html)**_ prevent the information from being released in any way that would identify a student.
Students who do not wish to have their information used can ask Statistics Canada to remove their identifying information from the national database. On request by a student Statistics Canada will delete an individual's contact information (name, address, or other personal identifiers) from the Postsecondary Student Information System (PSIS) database. To make such a request, please contact:

Queen’s University is required to disclose personal information such as Ontario Education Numbers, student characteristics and educational outcomes to the Minister of College and Universities under s. 15 of the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities Act, R.S.O. 1990, Chapter M.19, as amended. 
The Ministry collects this data for purposes such as planning, allocating and administering public funding to colleges, universities and other post-secondary educational and training institutions and to conduct research and analysis, including longitudinal studies, and statistical activities conducted by or on behalf of the Ministry for purposes that relate to post-secondary education and training.  
Further information on how the Minister of Colleges and Universities uses this personal information is available on the Ministry’s website: [Ministry of Colleges and Universities | ontario.ca](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ministry-colleges-universities). 
Queen’s may disclose the contact information of graduating students to organizations providing convocation-related services such as photography and degree framing unless directed otherwise by a student.  
Personal information—including name and/or email address—may be provided to external third-party survey agencies for the purpose of conducting surveys related to Queen's experiences (admission process, facilities, etc.), with the goal of improving the services provided by the University. Examples of such research and analyses include the **National Survey of Student Engagement**, administered from Indiana University, USA, and the **Public Economics Data Analysis Laboratory Project**.  
Personal information about graduands is also shared with the Member of Parliament for Kingston and the Islands to mail letters of congratulation upon graduation.  
The Office of Advancement may share personal information with third-party service providers to assist with mass mailings in order to communicate effectively with university donors and alumni. This includes service providers who help assemble, package, and address printed material for mailing or mass email, and events management system providers to help execute and prepare for events hosted by the university. The Office of Advancement does not rent, trade, or sell mailing, email, or telephone contact lists. All third-parties are carefully vetted for privacy and security before entering a data-sharing agreement.

## Policies & Appeals
## Fee Policies
The Board of Trustees reserves the right to make changes, without notice, in the scale of fees. If fee changes are approved after publication deadlines, every effort will be made to notify students affected. However, lack of notification does not exempt a student from paying the appropriate fee. Normally, fee increases, if applicable, become effective September 1 each year. Acceptance of fee payment does not necessarily imply acceptance of registration.
While every effort is made to avoid errors in fee assessment, should an error occur, it will be corrected and every effort is made to attempt to notify affected students. However, lack of notification does not exempt a student from paying the appropriate fee.
* [Ancillary fees](https://www.queensu.ca/registrar/tuition-fees/ancillary "Ancillary Fees") for the next academic year are approved by the Board of Trustees at their May meeting. Therefore, students registered full or part-time, who start their program in May, may be assessed ancillary fees retroactively
The Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Development (MAESD) regulates the fees that universities are permitted to charge students. These guidelines are a reference for Queen’s faculty and staff to evaluate whether specific course related fees are allowable under the MAESD protocol.
[Guidelines to Queen’s Compulsory Course Related Fees](https://www.queensu.ca/registrar/sites/uregwww/files/uploaded_files/pdfs/Policy/Financial%20Aid%20and%20Fee%20Policies%20and%20Appeals/Guidelines_Course_Related_Fees.pdf) (PDF, 391.7 KB)
The university accepts no responsibility for uninsured medical expenses incurred by students or their dependents. International students who do not have health or hospital insurance valid in Ontario during OHIP's 3-month waiting period, will be enrolled  for the University Health Insurance Plan (UHIP). For more information, visit [https://quic.queensu.ca/health-insurance/enrolment](https://quic.queensu.ca/health-insurance/enrolment%C2%A0) 
* International students registered at Queen's University and residing in Ontario must enrol themselves, and their dependents in Ontario, in mandatory basic health insurance through the University Health Insurance Plan (UHIP)
* Canadian students from other provinces must inform their local Ministry of Health that they will be studying in Ontario. Canadian students from outside Canada are eligible to apply for free provincial basic health insurance (Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP)) while studying in Ontario.
The cost of assessment materials bundled with electronic learning materials is exempt from the requirements for approval according to an ancillary fee protocol. The university notes that such costs to students in need are offset by funding from the [Queen’s General Bursary.](https://www.queensu.ca/registrar/financial-aid/application-required/current-students/general-bursary "General Bursary") Nevertheless, if students find it an exceptional hardship to afford the cost of assessment materials bundled with electronic learning materials required for a course and to be used to create a significant portion of the final grade, they may appeal for an increase in their General Bursary assessment.
Once a payment has been returned from the bank for any reason, a $40 service charge is applied. If the return was caused by a bank error, on request, the Office of the University Registrar will issue a receipt for the service charge in the event you wish to seek reimbursement from your bank.
Semi-annually, in June and November, overdue accounts from the preceding summer, fall, and winter terms may be placed in the hands of a collection agency. For more information, visit the [Financial Services website.](https://www.queensu.ca/financialservices/students)
A service charge, (prime + 3%), will be assessed on the 15th day of each month. Service charges are calculated on the overdue amount. Starting September 2015, no service charges will be levied in September, January, and May.

## Appeal Processes
If your payment is made less than five (5) business days before the fee deadline, it is likely that your payment will not be posted to SOLUS by the due date.
If you have been charged a late fee, you may appeal the late fee if your payment was made prior to the due date but the amount was not posted to your account until after that date.
Please include a copy of your proof of payment with your appeal and send it to [fees@queensu.ca](mailto:fees@queensu.ca) or fax: 613.533.2068.
Senate Policy states that official transcripts may not be released until the outstanding account is settled in full or until an acceptable arrangement for settling the account is made.
This policy will be waived in the following circumstances and at the written request of the student.
* **BEd Students**: One transcript may be sent to the Ontario College of Teachers
* **Law Students**: One transcript may be released to a second year law student for the purpose of applying for an articling position that they would take up after they finish their law degree. One transcript may be released to the Law Society for the purpose of being called to the Bar
If you require a transcript, but cannot pay the outstanding debt in full, please submit an appeal for a transcript, including your proposed payment arrangement by submitting the following form: [Outstanding Debt- Transcript Appeal](https://queensu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_555hZV37t4q3hKS).
If your appeal is approved, only one transcript will be released to the intended recipient. It will not be released directly to the student.
Students are expected to familiarize themselves with the Queen’s University Fees Policy, the Payment Due Dates, Refund Policy, and Financial Drop Deadlines.
In rare situations, a student may wish to submit an appeal for a Tuition Fee Amendment on the grounds of serious extenuating circumstances (e.g., sudden injury or sudden onset of illness; death of an immediate family member; or other serious life crisis) that prevent the student from completing their courses. 
Such extenuating circumstances may warrant a reversal/refund, in part or in full of their assessed tuition fees after the last date for refund/reversal within the published withdrawal schedule.
Students must submit a letter outlining the nature of the appeal along with supporting documentation from a healthcare professional (e.g., physician, psychologist, counsellor, etc.), or in cases of death, a copy of the death certificate or obituary notice is required.  
Financial appeals may take up to 60 days to finalize.
NOTE:  A successful academic petition does not guarantee a successful financial appeal.
**Financial Appeal Tuition Fees Submission Deadlines**  
* Fall Session (September – December) Deadline of April 30th. 
* Winter Session (January – April) Deadline of August 31st 
* Full Academic Year (September – April) Deadline of August 31st 
* Summer Session (May-August) Deadline of December 31st 
Please complete the [Appeal for Tuition Fee Amendment](https://queensu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eeZgEJO5A13GBXE) form to initiate your request.
[Senate Policy](https://www.queensu.ca/registrar/node/87#student-debtors) states that any student with an overdue debt with the university will not be permitted to register until the outstanding account is settled in full or until an acceptable arrangement for settling the account is made.
If you wish to register, but cannot pay the outstanding debt in full, please **submit an appeal** to register with debt. Your appeal must include:
* A description of the extenuating circumstances that led to the outstanding balance
* A budget that outlines ALL of your expenses and sources of income
* A repayment plan
To appeal to register with debt, complete the [ATRWD form](https://queensu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5AAXGCCH4ocFcxg). For any questions or concerns, please email [reg.appeals@queensu.ca](mailto:reg.appeals@queensu.ca).
* If OSAP is one of your sources of income, be sure to apply for OSAP **before** you submit your appeal. The appeals committee will provide a decision only after OSAP has provided an assessment
* If you are appealing for a Tuition Fee Amendment, the appeals committee will consider your appeal to register with debt **after** you provide the decision for the Tuition Fee Amendment
Before appealing to the University Registrar’s Tuition and Fee Appeals Committee, students must exhaust their opportunities to appeal to the unit that assessed the fees in question. The University Registrar’s Tuition and Fee Appeals committee is called on to make decisions regarding second-level appeals of tuition, student fees, and all other administrative fees charged by the university. The committee focuses on cases that fall outside of current precedents. Therefore, **the first-level of an appeal must initially be reviewed, and a decision made, by the office that assessed the fee.**
* If, for example, a student wishes to appeal their tuition or student fees, the student must first complete an Appeal of Tuition Fee Amendment form and submit it to the Office of the University Registrar
* If the appeal is regarding a charge for Student Wellness Centre services, then the initial appeal must first be heard by that office, etc.
An appeal to the University Registrar’s Tuition and Fee Appeals committee will only be considered after the initial appeal has been denied. The Committee does not hear appeals denied on the basis of a standing precedent by the office assessing the fee. The committee will only hear appeals based on an appellant providing new information or showing that an error was made by a department that resulted in fees being posted inappropriately. Normally, **only currently registered students may appeal tuition and fees.**
An appeal to the University Registrar’s Tuition and Fee Appeals Committee must be commenced within **12 weeks of the negative decision of the office assessing the fee**. Appeals to the University Registrar’s Tuition and Fee Appeals committee must be submitted in writing (with all appropriate documentation) to [toni.easter@queensu.ca](mailto:toni.easter@queensu.ca) or faxed to the attention of Ms. Easter at (613) 533-6409.
* Appellants will not normally be permitted to make in-person presentations to the committee
* The Chair of the committee will communicate the decision to the appellant within ten (10) business days of the meeting where the decision was made
* The decisions of the committee are final

# [Creating and Maintaining File Naming Standards](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/node/87) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/node/87_

 [Creating and Maintaining File Naming Standards (PDF, 243 KB)](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/sites/oapwww/files/uploaded_files/FileNamingQueens-RecMgtandPrivacy-2022-02-04-FINAL.pdf)
This guideline is designed to assist your unit, not intended to cause you to change your entire way of working. File naming should be tailored to best suit your working methods. Ultimately, what matters most is agreement on which standards to adopt, and consistently applying them.
## **Why do we need standards for file names?**
Establishing electronic file-naming standards, specifically tailored to each unit’s business needs will:
* improve access to documents and make sure that the right documents are available at the right time to support the daily business operations of each unit;
* facilitate more effective collaborative work between employees; and
* ensure that electronic files are easy to locate for records retention purposes.
In addition, consistent use of a standardized set of file names will be cost-effective for the university by decreasing the time needed to locate documents when responding to formal requests for information.
This guideline is to be used as a basis for naming electronic documents thoughtfully and consistently. All employees should endeavour to apply these standards within their unit in the regular course of business.
* * *
## **How to Begin**
Each unit should establish file-naming standards for:
* files that support unit core activities; and/or
* files that are routinely shared with others.
Your unit should identify file naming standards appropriate to its unique business needs. These standards should enable you to distinguish between files with similar names and enable you to identify documents without the need to open and review them.
There are four basic elements of a file name that should commonly be incorporated when naming a file. These elements include:
* a subject description that indicates the content or purpose of the file;
* an abbreviation of the Unit or Project to which the file is related;
* the date of the current edit of the file; and
* the state of the document (whether the file is a draft or final version).
Examples:
**BudgetAnalysis2016-FinService-2017-10-22-DRAFT.docx**
**BudgetAnalysis2016-FinService-2017-10-22-V3.docx**
**BudgetAnalysis2016-FinService-2017-10-22-FINAL.xlsx**
Elements in a file name should be sorted in the most logical way to retrieve the record, which may differ from record to record but should not have a negative impact on existing working practices.
* * *
## **How to Proceed**
Use the following naming conventions to help your unit establish file-naming standards.
### ****1\. Short Meaningful Names****
Short file names are preferable because a long file name means a long file path or, when posting a document on the web, a long URL. This increases the risk of broken links from web pages and error messages when users attempt to view documents.
Meaningful names are used so as to provide a clear indication of the content. A folder named “Letters” might sound appropriate, but when the letters are all of a different nature (various subjects, incoming, outgoing, etc.) it offers little assistance in retrieval.
A file name does not require every single word in the document title to be used in order to identify it. It is also possible to use standard abbreviations. For example, “cmte” is a standard abbreviation for “committee” and can be used in all committee-related areas providing it is commonly understood.
Abbreviations only work if everyone uses them; inventing new abbreviations that only one person understands will negate the ease and efficiency of the system.
Example:
Instead of naming a document **the employment and finance committee.doc**
It can be named: **EmpFinCmte.doc**
When using acronyms, each letter should appear in capitals, as should the first letter of the following word. Only the first letter of an abbreviated word should be a capital.
Example:
Instead of naming a document **EmpFinCmteTermsOfReference.doc**
It can be named: **EmpFinCmteTOR.doc**
* * *
### ****2\. Separating Words****
Spaces, hyphens, and underscores are not universally recognized by all computing technologies within file names and can cause problems where files are published on the web or transferred across databases or systems, so they should be used with discretion. While spaces great for human readability, they are remarkably inconvenient in computer resource locators. Any spaces in URLs are converted to the encoded space character by the web browser turning “**reference data.doc**” into “**reference%20data.doc**” when published online. Hyphens and underscores are less problematic, but are read differently depending on the environment you use them in. If you use an underscore, some technologies such as web browsers will combine the characters on either side into one word. Therefore, **reference\_data\_2019\_01\_05.doc** would appear as **referencedata20190105.doc** to the browser. You would have to search for “**reference\_data\_2019**” or “**referencedata2019**” as a query term to find that document. Where hyphens are seen as separate words by the browser, so **reference-data-2019-01-05.doc** can be successfully queried using “**reference data 2019**”. Another option is that instead of separating the words, each word can be identified using capital letters to identify the start of each word, known as medial capitals it is also called **CamelCase**.
Example:
Instead of naming a document **staff appeal.doc** or **staff\_appeal.doc**
It can be named: **StaffAppeal.doc** or **staff-appeal.doc**
In summary, avoid using spaces and underscores, use CamelCase when possible, use hyphens when CamelCase will not suffice as in the example of dates.
* * *
### ****3\. Characters****
Use only alphanumeric characters (letters and numbers) in file naming whenever possible. Avoid using special character marks, such as asterisks, question marks, or periods, which do not transition well if the file is published to the web.
Example:
Instead of naming a document **Budget&FinanceReport~2014~(Draft)**
It can be called: **BudFinRep2014-DRAFT**
* * *
### ****4\. Numbering****
Use two-digit numbers (or more when appropriate) when including non-year numbers in the file name. Using zero(s) before numbers will maintain the alphanumeric ordering, and assist retrieval by placing the latest files last.
Instead of:
Use:
Report1.doc
Report01.doc
Report10.doc
Report02.doc
Report11.doc
Report03.doc
Report2.doc
Report04.doc
Report3.doc
Report05.doc
Report4.doc
Report06.doc
Report5.doc
Report07.doc
Report6.doc
Report08.doc
Report7.doc
Report09.doc
Report8.doc
Report10.doc
Report9.doc
Report11.doc
(As the system sorts the files)
(As the system sorts the files)
* * *
### ****5\. Dates****
Year-first dating is used to sort files where it is useful to maintain the chronology of their creation within a folder. The date format should always follow the style of four digit years, two digit months and two digit days, i.e., YYYYMM-DD = 2008-09-01 for September 1st, 2008.
Placing the year first allows for easy sorting (and ultimately easier disposal) by date. This can be very important with items such as tracking the history of a set of correspondence or when documents relating to regular meetings held over the course of a year are stored in a single folder.
Instead of:
Use:
11Nov2013Minutes.pdf
2004-10-31Agenda.pdf
16Feb2005Agenda.pdf
2005-02-16Agenda.pdf
25Dec2005Minutes.pdf
2005-12-25Minutes.pdf
31Oct2004Agenda.pdf
2008-07-04Enclosure1.pdf
4July2008Enclosure1.pdf
2013-11-11Minutes.pdf
(As the system sorts the files)
(As the system sorts the files)
Not all dates will require the actual day of creation to be included in the file name. Some may require just the month, the year or a date range. These should still follow the rules of year-first dating.
Examples:
**YYYY-MM = 2008-09**
**YYYY = 2008**
**YYYY–YYYY = 2007-2008**
When including the academic, calendar or fiscal year designation, use the two-letter abbreviations (AY, CY or FY) followed by the last two digits of the year.
Examples:
**AuditNotes-FinService-FY11-FINAL**
**AuditNotes-FinService-CY08-DRAFT**
**AuditNotes-FinService-AY10-V2** 
* * *
### ****6\. Personal Names****
Always place the surname first, followed by the initials or the first name when saving items that require the inclusion of a person’s name.
Examples:
**BrownP**
**EdwardsA**
**JamesDavid**
**JamesDonna**
* * *
### ****7\. Placement of Words****
Avoid placing words that indicate the format of a document at the beginning of the file name.
For example, placing the word “draft” at the start will group all files beginning with that word together, sorting unrelated items into groups. It is far more useful to have the subject at the start of the file name so related subjects will group together.
Instead of:
Use:
DraftFinancePlan.xls
BudgetReportDRAFT.doc
DraftBudgetReport.doc
BudgetReportFINAL.doc
FinalFinancePlan.xls
FinPlanDRAFT.xls
FinalBudgetReport.doc
FinPlanFINAL.xls
(As the system sorts the files)
(As the system sorts the files)
Indications of the version of the document such as DRAFT or FINAL should be used in all caps and placed at the end of a file name to make it easier to visually identify the status of the file.
Example:
**AuditNotes-VPFin-2011-06-20-FINAL.docx** 
* * *
### ****8\. Documentation and Training****
To ensure that all of the efforts taken in the previous steps are preserved, documentation should be created to capture the procedure for establishing various naming conventions for different file types. If the decision making process and the final results are recorded, they can be more easily passed on to workers in your office as reference material and more importantly used in training during the onboarding process. To assist with this step the Records Management office has created a [**Recordkeeping Protocol**](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/node/91) document, which can be accessed from the [Guidance](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/node/23) page of the Records Management and Privacy office website.
* * *
## ********In Conclusion********
No matter what file naming standards your unit elects to implement, only if all employees within your unit (current and future) apply these standards consistently in the regular course of business can your file naming convention be effective and useful. If you would like assistance in establishing your file naming conventions [contact the Records Management and Privacy Office](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/node/14).

## Out-of-Province Interest-Free Status
If you are **receiving full-time government student financial aid** from your province for the current/upcoming study period, your lender (loan servicer) will automatically update your interest-free status based on the study period dates of your current government aid application once your application has processed and full-time enrolment is confirmed.
If you are **not receiving government student financial aid** from your province for the current/upcoming study period and are enrolled in a full-time course load, you are responsible to update your lender/service provider with your enrolment status. To avoid accruing irreversible interest on your previous government loans, the lender must be updated before your six-month grace period elapses. However, you must be enrolled in full-time studies at the time you submit your request and the request must be submitted prior to the end of your current study period. 
**We can only confirm full-time enrolment for the current study period.  We are not permitted to confirm enrolment for previous academic years.**
**Note:** If you apply for government student financial aid late or there is a delay in the processing of your current government funding application and you will not receive your first instalment at the start of your study period, we recommend you update your lender/service provider to avoid accruing interest.
Enrolment in a minimum 60% course load in each term of study (40% course load for students with a permanent disability) can reinstate the interest-free status on government student loans (discontinue payment) during the period of full-time enrolment. Students from outside the province of Ontario may consult the information outlined below for an explanation of how to submit a request for confirmation of enrolment for interest-free status. Ontario students may submit an online “[Continuation of Interest-Free Status (CIFS)](https://www.queensu.ca/registrar/financial-aid/application-required/government/osap/interest-free-status "Maintaining Interest-Free Status") Application” available via their account on the [OSAP website](https://www.ontario.ca/page/osap-ontario-student-assistance-program).
We recommend you follow up with your respective lender/service provider to ensure information has been received and interest-free status has been reinstated. Contact your Financial Aid and Awards if you have submitted a request and your interest-free status has not been reinstated (before your 6-month grace period elapses).

The DEVS DSC is the undergraduate student council for the Queen’s University Global Development Studies Department. We are a growing team of volunteers from the Global Development undergraduate program aiming to create a highly connected DEVS community. As well as creating social connections within the DEVS community, we are a resource for academic support for DEVS students. The DEVS DSC acts as a liaison between undergraduate students, faculty, and student government.
Our team meets weekly to plan and conceptualize both social and academic events for the department. Our events are diverse, and involve things like meeting professors, study sessions, social events, and many more! We also facilitate connection within the DEVS community through our mentorship program, as well as our upcoming website which will feature discussion boards for students to connect with each other. We also release department merchandise every year as a fundraiser. 
The DEVS DSC is heavily involved with academic planning and advocacy for undergraduate students. If you would like to get involved, or have something to bring to our attention, we invite you to contact us via email or social media!

## Canadian Disability Policy Alliance (CDPA)
[The Canadian Disability Policy Alliance (CDPA)](http://www.disabilitypolicyalliance.ca/) is a national collaboration of 14 researchers in disability studies from 4 Canadian universities, 5 disability advocacy organizations, and consultants from federal and provincial governments.  Since July 2009, the Alliance has conducted 27 research projects, aimed at evaluating and improving disability policy in Canada.
As of July 2013, the CDPA has completed 4 years of its five-year research agenda.  In partnerships between researchers and disability advocates, we have undertaken projects covering a wide variety of issues affecting people with disabilities, including education, employment, health care, and civic engagement.
Over the coming year, we propose to disseminate these research findings to individuals and organizations involved in disability issues, such as yourself.  We hope some of this information may help you to continue to achieve meaningful change for people with disabilities in Canada.  Please feel free to share or use anything we send you.
The CDPA employs a unique methodology for emancipatory research and knowledge mobilization, known as the **Learning Collaborative**. Derived from research on health system improvement, the Learning Collaborative focuses on small but meaningful increments of change that can be readily achieved and studied, then expanded to effect broader outcomes.
   [The Learning Collaborative: An approach to emancipatory research in disability studies (PDF - 512 KB)](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/sites/ahwww/files/uploaded_files/research/CJDS-Article-200113.pdf)
In an effort to assist policy makers and policy analysts to reflect on the adequacy of policy for disabled Canadians, we developed the Disability Lens, a series of questions derived from “tips for policy analysis” _(in McColl and Jongbloed, 2006._ Disability and social policy in Canada, 2nd ed.) These questions are intended to provide a quick, easy guide to assessing the important implications of policy decisions for people with disabilities.

## Regional Assessment and Resource Centre (RARC)
Part of the mandate of the [Regional Assessment and Resource Centre (RARC)](http://www.queensu.ca/rarc) is to engage in systematic, multidisciplinary research. Our research focuses on adult assessment and outcomes for persons with specific learning or attention disorders. Findings from our research efforts help ensure that students receive an accurate diagnosis of their difficulties so that appropriate treatments and supports can be put in place. We are also interested in determining which transition supports and services have the most beneficial impact for students as they transition to post-secondary studies and also into the workforce.

###### _Photo credit - Stephen Wild (October 18, 2024)_
The University Council was established by statute in 1874. It is one of the three governing bodies of the University. The elective members of the Council are elected by and from among the alumni of the University in a manner provided for by the By-laws of the Council.  The Council serves as both an advisory and an ambassadorial body to the University as a whole and is responsible for the election of the Chancellor.
Although it is not directly involved in operations, the Council may bring to the Senate or Board of Trustees any matter that it believes affects Queen's well-being and prosperity. In this way the Council, in plenary session and through study committees, has made important contributions to several areas of campus life.

[](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/sites/oapwww/files/uploaded_files/FactSheet-WorkingRemotely.pdf) [Working Remotely (PDF, 395 KB)](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/sites/oapwww/files/uploaded_files/FactSheet-WorkingRemotely.pdf)
## Working Remotely: Access to Information, Protection of Privacy, and Records Management
Now more than ever before, large numbers of Queen’s employees are working remotely. Some may find difficulty in completing tasks they used to do with ease in the past, in part due to new and different work environments. The shift to a remote environment may necessitate using non-university resources such as private internet connections, personal telephones, and home computers.
The ability of the Queen’s community to adjust to this new work reality is laudable and shows employees’ adaptability, resourcefulness, and commitment. What may not be top of mind is employees’ continued recordkeeping responsibilities, ensuring that records documenting university decisions and actions are created and retained, and that information is properly managed at all times. Good recordkeeping is accomplished by being forward-thinking and by using the correct tools in an appropriate manner.
In accordance with the [Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90f31) (FIPPA), Queen’s has a continued obligation of transparency and accountability to the Queen’s community and the general public who all have a fundamental right to access the university’s general records and their own personal information.
Employees must ensure they take adequate measures to preserve the university’s records and information by working conscientiously and following the practices below.
## Avoiding a privacy breach
The change in work routines not only raises concerns about maintaining employee effectiveness and productivity, but also risks the potential of a privacy breach if physical and digital environments at home are not as secure as the ones provided to employees at their office. Queen’s University employees handle a wide array of personal, health, and other confidential information, and must do their utmost to ensure that their remote work environments offer the same level of protection as their work environments on campus.
**If a breach of privacy occurs or is suspected, read and follow the [privacy breach protocol](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/privacy/breaches "Privacy Breaches") and contact the [Chief Privacy Officer](mailto:access.privacy@queensu.ca?subject=Privacy%20Breach) as soon as possible.**
###  PRIVACY BREACH PROTOCOL
**If a privacy breach occurs, take immediate action.**
1. **CONTAIN**: stop or contain the breach if you can
 
2. **REPORT**: to your immediate supervisor, the unit or department head, and the Chief Privacy Officer at [access.privacy@queensu.ca](mailto:access.privacy@queensu.ca) who will assist with the next steps
 
3. **INVESTIGATE**: use the step-by-step Privacy Breach Report Form (to be provided by the Chief Privacy Officer) to collect information and address the breach
 
## Maintaining privacy and confidentiality
Queen’s University is subject to various regulatory and policy-driven requirements regarding privacy and confidentiality of information, including the [Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90f31) (FIPPA), the [Personal Health Information Protection Act](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/04p03) (PHIPA), the [Electronic Information Security Policy Framework](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/senate/electronic-information-security-policy-framework), and the [Records Management Policy](https://www.queensu.ca/secretariat/policies/administration-and-operations/records-management-policy). These requirements must continue to be met by Queen’s employees who are working remotely.
Remote workers are required take all reasonable steps to secure and maintain the confidentiality of Queen’s University information and records while they are being transported to and from an employee’s off-site workspace, and while the documents are stored at the off-site workspace no matter if the information is in physical or digital format. Records and information must be protected from being damaged, destroyed, stolen, copied, or otherwise accessed by unauthorized individuals.
* When remotely accessing records and information it is essential that employees use the [Queen's Campus Virtual Private Network](https://www.queensu.ca/its/networks/virtual-private-network-vpn) (VPN). The Queen’s VPN (Fortinet FortiClient) is a safe and easy way to ensure a secure, remote internet connection to on-campus resources.
 
* Any device (such as a laptop, desktop, cellphone) used to perform university business must be encrypted. This includes personal devices such as a personal cellphone or home computer. [Encryption protects against a data breach even if the device is lost or stolen](https://queensu.service-now.com/esm?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0011837&sys_kb_id=d8b7a50b1b11051038e4da43cc4bcb6e). Ensure that “Find my Device” is enabled or that the “Find My” app is installed so that in the event of a theft, the device can be located, locked, or erased remotely.
 
* Queen’s employees working remotely must not allow anyone else, such as a spouse or child, to use devices that contain work-related documents. In addition to being encrypted, devices must be password protected and those passwords are not to be shared with others, including family members. Screens should be set to lock when not in use. Employees should also be conscious of the visibility of their screen to other people in the remote workspace when accessing confidential university records and information.
 
* With respect to hard-copy documents, employees must be careful about who can view them during the day, and store them away in a box or file folder when not in use. At the end of the day, lock them away in a cabinet or closet if possible.
 
* When destroying [transitory records](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/guidance/transitory-records "Transitory Records"), employees must take measures appropriate to the medium. Digital records may simply be deleted, while non-confidential hardcopy records may be recycled. Ensure that confidential hardcopy documents are shredded using a cross-cut shredder. If such a shredder is not available in the remote workplace, return confidential documents to campus for appropriate disposal using university vendors or facilities. Review the [Data Classification Standard](https://www.queensu.ca/its/governance-instruments/data-classification-standard) to ensure documents you are intending to dispose of are destroyed appropriately.
 
* For disposal of official records, ensure they are eligible for disposal by referring to the Queen’s University [records retention schedules](https://archives.queensu.ca/records-retention-schedules) or contact the [Records Manager](mailto:Recordsmanagement@queensu.ca) for assistance.
 
## Teleconferencing and video conferencing
When taking part in a teleconference or video conference, employees should maintain an awareness of the confidentiality of those meetings, classes, or events. Consider whether it is possible for others in the remote workplace to overhear confidential conversations. Whether you are the host or a participant, take note of these tips for enhancing confidentiality.
* Be mindful that while many devices have video capability, some individuals may prefer to participate using voice only, or to obscure the background of their meeting space.
 
* Unless there is a compelling reason to do so, avoid taking screenshots or video or audio recordings of meetings, classes, or events. Such images and recordings become records and require proper management and storage. Furthermore, they may become subject to an access to information request.
 
* If recording or taking a screenshot is desirable, give participants notice in advance. Some tools such as Microsoft Teams automatically notify participants when a meeting is being recorded. The notice should also be repeated at the beginning of the recording to document the notice and to state the purpose of the recording by the person who intends to record.
 
* If a recording is made, it should be retained no longer than necessary and deleted after its purpose has been met (e.g., after meeting minutes have been created). Recordings leave a variety of indicators as to their creation, existence, and, depending upon the technology used, even their deletion.
 
If teleconferencing or video conferencing is used to facilitate student advising or other kinds of medical or counselling activities, it is **essential** that privacy is maintained. **Employees must ensure their work environment is private**, and that the use of any recording technology will be done only with consent. **Consent must be documented**. Furthermore, only secure platforms may be used. See the resources listed below and seek guidance from IT Services if you are unsure about which platform to use.
 **For information about confidentiality and privacy in the remote classroom, see the fact sheet on [Privacy and Remote Teaching & Learning](https://www.queensu.ca/accessandprivacy/guidance/privacy-and-remote-teaching-and-learning "Privacy and Remote Teaching and Learning").**
## Creating and managing university records
As university employees work remotely, more university business is being handled using a variety of technologies that document our efforts, including email, chat logs, text messaging, and virtual meetings. While some records may be created with intent, some tools create ancillary records, leaving “digital tracks” of the work employees do. While some of these tracks are useful, others are transitory fragments that add up to very little. When using online tools, employees must realize that their text conversations, recordings, and even sharing of files could become matters of public record.
* Chat messages in the Posts tab of a Teams space, or as a message in a Teams or Zoom meeting, are no different than email messages in that they are in fact records. While messaging is often less formal and more fluid than email, the messages, when they relate to university business, are university records.
 
* The language and conduct of the chat should always be professional. Additionally, these messages may need to be preserved if they contain substantial decisions or other university business.
 
* If messages are transitory and are deleted after they have been read there is still often evidence of this deletion, so be mindful of what is put into a chat and be aware that the deletion itself is visible and can look questionable even if the content was benign.
 
* In some instances, it may be desirable to connect with your colleagues via a phone call or a video meeting rather than use messaging functions especially when dealing with the personal information of students.
 
* Be mindful that some of what is communicated using these various tools may need to be produced as evidence of decisions or actions taken, or to satisfy legal inquiries or access to information requests.
 
FIPPA applies to records in the custody or under the control of an institution. Emails, chats, texts, and other communication sent or received for business purposes, even those sent using personal accounts, have been found by Ontario’s Information and Privacy Commissioner to be under an institution’s control for the purposes of FIPPA and therefore required to be disclosed. Accordingly, always use these tools mindfully.
When employees return to campus after a period of remote work it is crucial that the documents they removed from their office be returned and that any records created while working remotely are filed in their unit’s recordkeeping systems, both hardcopy and digital.
## Access to information rights
Employees must be mindful that Queen’s University has a legal obligation to provide access to information and ensure reasonable measures are in place to document and preserve records, and that this obligation continues to apply to all employees who are working remotely.
* All work-related records continue to be subject to [access to information legislation](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90f31), regardless of whether they are retained on Queen’s-issued or personal computing and storage devices.
* Employees should continue to use established records management practices and file records in Queen’s recordkeeping systems.
* When working remotely employees must digitize or transfer all business records to work-related systems and repositories as soon as possible to allow for improved access controls and security to be applied to the records.
* Employees must appropriately back up business records when using personal computing and storage devices if files are not retained in Queen’s IT Services-supported storage spaces such as the departmental shared drive or an MS 365 cloud tool like SharePoint.

 _https://www.queensu.ca/grad-postdoc/grad-studies/funding/administering-awards_

## Administering Awards
At Queen’s, all awards (scholarships, fellowships, prizes, QGA, etc.) administered by or through the SGSPA are paid through direct deposit to the recipient’s bank account of record (see below). This direct deposit method is only for those internal and external awards, fellowships, scholarships, Queen’s Graduate Award (QGA), etc. administered by the SGSPA.
If you have completed registration, set up a bank account of record, and met the eligibility requirements of your award, your funds will appear in your bank account within 5 to 7 business days after the ‘posted date’ on the Student On-Line University System (SOLUS).
Your department has a separate process to make arrangements for Teaching Assistantship (TA) and Research Assistantship (RA) payments to be deposited in your bank account.
If you pay tuition through the Pre-Authorized Payment Plan, the bank account used for the tuition payment is your bank account of record. If you pay tuition in any other way, you must set up a bank account of record to receive direct deposits of your award payments.
The bank account of record must be held at a valid Canadian bank. The bank account of record will receive award payments for any award you receive for the duration of your graduate student enrolment.
To confirm your bank account of record or to set up banking information, log in to SOLUS and enter or review your banking information (found at the bottom of the page under “enter/review bank”).
Any award installment payments are shown in SOLUS in your “Student Centre." Scroll down to the “Finances” section, and under “Other Financial” select “Payments” to see your “Payment history," which is a record of awards paid to date or scheduled to be paid.
The “Date Paid” is the date that the direct deposit is "Initiated". Please note that you must add 4 to 5 business days after the “Date Paid” date, or to the date that you have completed registration, set up your bank account of record, and/or met any other eligibility requirements, for these funds to appear in your bank account of record.
Students who transfer from full-time on-campus status to part-time or inactive status are not eligible for most fellowships, scholarships, and awards (including QGA). If funding has already been provided for the term(s) of proposed part-time or inactive status, that funding must be returned to the School of Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs. Changing to part-time or inactive status may impact your repayment requirements to OSAP or any other student loan provider.

We recommend adding your name to the waitlist as soon as possible.\***
##### Our core belief is the supporting principle that play is the means by which children learn. A well-planned and developmentally appropriate program, that makes space for spontaneous activity and is responsive to the needs and interests of the children is most meaningful. In order to achieve this, we use the foundations of belonging, well-being, engagement and expression that are discussed in the pedagogical document [How Does Learning Happen](http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/childcare/HowLearningHappens.pdf). Our program values active learning through exploration, play and inquiry; we see play as enjoyable, spontaneous and active and as an authentic and appropriate way for children to learn about the world around them.
##### The staff of Queen’s Daycare Centre believe that relationship is the foundation of quality care and that children will thrive in environments that are positive and supportive of them as individuals and of their families and when they are in warm, caring and responsive relationships with adults. Our educators join the children in their play as co-learners, collaborators, observers and intentional communicators. We seek to establish nurturing and responsive relationships, form positive perspectives, and promote the development of self-regulation as we come alongside the children in our care in order to create an atmosphere where children feel supported to try new things, take risks, grow and learn.

# [onQ Accessibility | Accessibility Hub](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/tutorials/onq-accessibility) 
 _https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/tutorials/onq-accessibility_

## Headings
Using Headings makes it easier for various adaptive technologies to navigate a document. Many people do not create Headings correctly, either making font sizes bigger or in bold rather than using the formats already provided by onQ. Heading levels should have a meaningful hierarchy and it is recommended to reserve H1 for the page title, H2 for major headings and H3 for major sub headings.
onQ has pre-formatted heading and subheading styles you can use to organize content:
1. Place your cursor anywhere in the paragraph in which you would like the new heading style to be applied.
2. Select the dropdown menu on the **Format** button.
3. Select the heading style you want to apply. Your text will be changed to the selected heading style.
  [Designing for the Web: The Web Standards and Accessibility Development Guide](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/across-campus/web-standards-and-accessibility-development-guide/designing-web "Designing for the web")
## Lists
Formatting lists, headings, and links help screen reader users understand the content in context. To create a list in the onQ html editor, select the content you want to make into a list. Then on the toolbar, click either the **Unordered List** icon of the order doesn’t matter, or the **Ordered List** icon if the order does matter (unordered list will be bullet points, ordered list will create numbered items).
## Images and Graphics (including Graphs, Maps & Shapes)
### Alternative Text
Alternative text must give an accurate description of what the item is, so that if a screen reader or refreshable braille display is used, the “Alt tag” will convey the text alternative of the image.
To insert an image into a new onQ content file, place the cursor where you want to insert the image, and click on the **Insert Image** icon  from the toolbar. The “Add a File” window will open you can drag-and-drop a file in the upload window or click upload and navigate to where the image is and click on **Add**. The “Provide Alternate Text” window will open. Type in descriptive text for the image. It is important to write a description that conveys the reason you are including the image – see Below “How to Create Good Alternate Text”. If the image is only for decorative purposes, just click on **This image is decorative** check box and **OK**.
### How to Create Good Alternate Text
* Consider the content and function of your image.
* If it provides content to your document, make sure that the information the image provides is described in the alt text.
* If your image only provides a function (for example, providing a portrait of a historical figure described in the text) you need only describe the image. In the case that the image is of a historical figure, write his/her name as the alt text.
* Try not to use “Image of...” or “Graphic of...” as alt text. That is usually evident to the person reading the alt text.
* Do not repeat the information which is contained in the document itself into the alt text. If it's already in the document, that should be enough.
* Images used for a bullet or spacer should have an empty Alt tag i.e. alt=””
  [ALT Text: The Web Standards and Accessibility Development Guide](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/across-campus/web-standards-and-accessibility-development-guide/development/alt-text "ALT Text")
## Hyperlinks
To link your document to a website or another document, you may use hyperlinks. Below are some tips that web pages at Queen's University should follow:
* **Ensure that the hyperlink has context and describes where it leads**. It should not just read “click here”, and should make it clear what the destination of the link is (example, the web link [www.queensu.ca](http://www.queensu.ca/) should be written as "[Queen's University](http://www.queensu.ca/)").
* **Avoid language that requires spatial or visual references.** One of the greatest powers of the Internet is the ability to cross link related documents, allowing the reader to explore and learn in a non-linear fashion. Content authors must remember, however, that not all users will be experiencing their web pages the same way that the author may be. Instructing readers to click on a 'link on the right,' for example, does not take into consideration the fact that visually impaired users do not see left or right. The same holds true for references to colours or shapes (i.e. click on the 'round' button, or the 'green' text).
* **When linking to a file, indicate the format and document size** for example: Accessible Documents (PDF 75KB).
* **It is best practice that Hyperlinks should open in the same browser window_._** _In onQ you may have the link open in a new window to keep the course open for your students so they can navigate back to the course, but user should be notified when a link open in a new window (e.g. Queen's homepage (opens in a new window)._ Programming a link to open in a new browser window can cause difficulties with novice users for a variety of reasons (i.e. the new window does not retain the current window's browser history and disables the 'back' button function, or the launching of multiple pop-up windows may be blocked by a third-party application), and can disorient people who are using screen-reading or screen-magnification software.
To insert a link in a content file, click on the **Insert Quicklink** icon.
You can choose to link to another area in your course, file, link to an outside webpage etc. To link to an outside webpage, select **URL** in the **Insert Quicklink** window. Type (or paste) the web address into the **URL** field. Enter text that describes the link’s destination in the **Title** field. You will have three options to designate where the link will open.

  [Downloads: The Web Standards and Accessibility Development Guide](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/across-campus/web-standards-and-accessibility-development-guide/multimedia/downloads "Downloads")
## Tables
In websites, tables should be used to hold data and **NOT used for design layout**.
Screen readers read tables from left to right, top to bottom, one cell at a time. Merged, nested, and split cells change the reading order of tables. Make sure you construct your table in a way that accommodates good reading order. To create tables with column headers in onQ, create your table using the **Table** icon.
If you are using tables to present data, your table should have appropriate column or row headers. Designating headers in a table is essential to screen reader users understanding how the information is laid out. Highlight the row that you would like to designate as your column header and select the dropdown menu of the **Table** icon. Select **Cell Properties**, and in the **Cell Type** dropdown, you can designate your row or column as the Header.
  [Designing for the Web: The Web Standards and Accessibility Development Guide](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/across-campus/web-standards-and-accessibility-development-guide/designing-web "Designing for the web")
## Colour Contrast
You must provide high colour contrast to the text in your document. A good example of high colour contrast is black and white; while an example of poor colour contrast is light yellow and white.
onQ has a color tool that is very helpful for you to check color contrast. In the html content editing screen, select the text that you want to check and click the drop down menu next to the **Color** icon in the toolbar. When you select a color, the tool will automatically tell you if your selection meets WCAG AA standards with a green checkmark.
  [Colour: The Web Standards and Accessibility Development Guide](https://www.queensu.ca/accessibility/across-campus/web-standards-and-accessibility-development-guide/designing-web/colour "Colour")
## Accessibility Checker in onQ
The Accessibility Checker is used to review content within the HTML Editor to ensure that the HTML page conforms to the WCAG 2.0 accessibility standards. The Accessibility Checker will indicate if no issues are detected, or if issues are detected the checker will offer suggestions to fix the identified accessibility issue(s). The Accessibility Checker is located on the HTML Editor bar which can be accessed anywhere the HTML Editor is available, including News, Content, Quizzes, Dropboxes, Discussions, and Calendar.
If **issues are detected** a message will appear that indicates how the content does not meet guidelines and suggests a way to fix the issue.
* Select **Repair** to save the suggested fix, or **Ignore** to disregard the suggested fix.
* Use the **Previous** and **Next** buttons to move forward and backward between all detected issues and suggested fixes.
If **no issues are detected** a message will appear that indicates the content conforms to accessibility rules.

## **What is Geological Engineering?**
Geological Engineers connect earth sciences with engineering – they apply geosciences, mathematics, computing, physics, and chemistry to solve challenges in fields such as infrastructure engineering and construction, mining and energy resource exploration and development, environmental engineering, forensic engineering, and forestry, amongst others.
Any engineering project that interacts with the Earth or Earth materials in any way requires the input of Geological Engineers. For example, Geological Engineers will conduct geological and geotechnical studies to assess clean-up strategies or the suitability of locations for an array of infrastructure, environmental, mining operations, and energy projects. They will be part of impact studies for facilities and operations that impact the surface environment and subsurface.
